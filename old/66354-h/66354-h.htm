<p class="ph2">THE PROOF OF THE<br />
PUDDING</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>A YOUNG LADY OF MOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was three o&#8217;clock, but the luncheon the Kinneys
were giving at the Country Club had survived
the passing of less leisurely patrons and now dominated
the house. The negro waiters, having served
all the food and drink prescribed, perched on the
railing of the veranda outside the dining-room,
ready to offer further liquids if they should be demanded.
Such demands had not been infrequent
during the two hours that had intervened since the
party sat down, as a row of empty champagne
bottles in the club pantry testified. The negroes
watched with discreet grins the antics of a girl of
twenty-two who seemed to be the center of interest.
She had been entertaining the company with
a variety of impersonations of local characters,
rising and moving about for the better display of
her powers of mimicry. Hand-clapping and cries
of &#8220;Go on!&#8221; followed each of these performances.</p>

<p>She concluded an imitation of the head waiter&mdash;a
pompous individual who had viewed this impiety
with mixed emotions&mdash;and sank exhausted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
into her chair amid boisterous laughter. The flush
in her cheeks was not wholly attributable to the
heat of the June day, and the eagerness with which
she gulped a glass of champagne one of the men
handed her suggested a familiar acquaintance with
that beverage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Nan, give us Daddy Farley. Do old
Uncle Tim cussing the doctor&mdash;put it all in&mdash;that&#8217;s
a good little Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it, Nan; we&#8217;ve got to have it!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Kinney.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it will kill me to hear it again,&#8221; protested
Billy Copeland, who was refilling the girl&#8217;s
glass; &#8220;but I&#8217;d be glad to die laughing. It&#8217;s the
funniest stunt you ever did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s arms hung limp, and she sat, a crumpled,
dejected figure, glancing about frowningly
with dull eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all in; there&#8217;s nothing doing,&#8221; she replied
tamely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come along, Nan. We&#8217;ll go for a spin in the
country right afterwards,&#8221; said Mrs. Kinney&mdash;who
had just confided to a guest from Pittsburg,
for whom the party was given, that Nan&#8217;s imitation
of Daddy Farley abusing his doctor was
the killingest thing ever, and that she just must
hear it.</p>

<p>Their importunities were renewed to the accompaniment
of much thumping of the table, and
suddenly the girl sprang to her feet. She seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
immediately transformed as she began a minute
representation of the gait and speech of an old
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ignorant blackguard! you common, low
piece of swine-meat! How dare you come day after
day to torture me with your filthy nostrums!
You&#8217;ve poured enough dope into me to float a
battleship and given me pills enough to sink it, and
here I am limpin&#8217; around like a spavined horse, and
no more chance o&#8217;gettin&#8217; out o&#8217; here again than I
have of goin&#8217; to heaven! What&#8217;s that! You got the
cheek to offer to give up the case! Just like you to
want to turn me over to some other pirate and keep
me movin&#8217; till the undertaker comes along and
hangs out the crape! There&#8217;s been a dozen o&#8217; you
flutterin&#8217; in here like hungry sparrows lookin&#8217; for
worms. You don&#8217;t see anything in my old carcass
but worm-food! Hi, you! What you up to now?
Oh, Lord, don&#8217;t leave me! Come back here; come
back here, I say! Oh, my damned legs! How long
you say I&#8217;d better take that poison you sent up
here yesterday? Well, all right&#8221;&mdash;meekly&mdash;&#8220;I
guess I&#8217;ll try it. Where&#8217;s that nurse gone? You
better tell her again about the treatment. She forgets
it half the time; tell her to double the dose.
If I&#8217;ve got to die, I want to die full o&#8217; poison to
make it easier for the embalmer. I guess you&#8217;re
all right, doc; but you&#8217;re slow, mighty damned
slow. Hi, Nan, you grinnin&#8217; little fool, who told you
to come in here? Oh, Lord! Oh, my poor legs! Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
for God&#8217;s sake, doctor, do something for me&mdash;do
something for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tottered toward her chair, imaginably the
bed from which the old man had risen, and glanced
at her audience indifferently, as they broke into
hilarious applause. The vulgarity of the exhibition
was mitigated somewhat by her amazing success
in sinking herself in another personality. They
all knew that the man she was imitating was her
foster-father and benefactor; that he had rescued
her from obscure, hopeless poverty, educated her
and given her his name; and that but for his benevolence
they never would have known or heard
of her; but this clearly was not a company that
was fastidious in such matters. The exhibition of
her cleverness had been highly diverting. They
waved their napkins and demanded more.</p>

<p>She continued to survey them coldly, standing by
her chair and absently biting her lip. Then she
turned with an air of disdain and moved among the
tables to the nearest door with languid deliberation.
They watched her dully, mystified. This possibly
was a prelude to some further contribution to the
hour&#8217;s entertainment, and they craned their necks
to follow her, expecting that at any moment she
would turn back.</p>

<p>The screen door banged harshly upon her exit.
She crossed the veranda, ran down the steps toward
the canal that lay a little below the clubhouse, and
hurried away as though anxious to escape pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
or questioning. She came presently to the river,
pressed through a tangle of briars and threw herself
down on the bank under a majestic sycamore.</p>

<p>A woodpecker drummed upon a dead limb of the
tree, and a kingfisher looked down at her wonderingly.
She lay perfectly quiet with her face buried
in the grass. Hers was not a happy frame of mind.
Torn with contrition, she yielded herself to the luxury
of self-scorn. She had no intention of returning
immediately to the clubhouse, and she was infinitely
relieved that none of her late companions had followed
her. She wished that she might never see
them again. Then her mood changed and she sat
up, flung aside her hat, dipped her handkerchief in
the river and held it to her burning face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little fool, you silly little fool!&#8221; she said,
addressing her reflection in the water. She spoke
as though quoting, which was indeed exactly what
she was doing. It was just such endearing terms
that her foster-father applied to her in his frequent
fits of anger.</p>

<p>Then she stretched herself at ease with her hands
clasped under her head and stared at the sky. Beneath
the cloud of loosened black hair that her various
exertions had shaken free, her violet eyes were
fine and expressive. Her face was slender, with dimples
near the corners of her mouth: a sensitive face,
still fresh and girlish. Her fairness was that of her
type&mdash;a type markedly Irish. The wet handkerchief
that had brought away a faint blotch of scarlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
from her rather full lips had left them still red with
the sufficient color of youthful health. Lying relaxed
for half an hour, watching the lazily drifting white
clouds, she became tranquillized. Her eyes lost
their restlessness as she gazed dreamily at the
heavens.</p>

<p>The soft splash of oars caused her to lift her head
guardedly and glance out upon the river. A young
man was deftly urging a cedar skiff toward a huge
elm that had been uprooted by a spring storm and
lay with half its trunk submerged. He jumped out
and tied the skiff to a convenient limb and then,
standing on the trunk, adjusted a rod and line and
began amusing himself by dropping a brilliant fly
here and there on the rippling surface. It was inconceivable
that any one should imagine that fish
were to be wooed and won in this part of the
stream; even Nan knew better than that. But
failures apparently did not diminish the pleasure
the fisherman found in his occupation.</p>

<p>He was small and compactly made and wore
white flannel trousers, canvas shoes, and a pink
shirt with a four-in-hand to match. He moved
about freely on the log to give variety to his experiments;
he was indeed much nimbler with his feet
than with his hands, for his whipping of the stream
lacked the sophistication of skilled fly-casting. He
lighted a cigarette without abating his efforts, and
commented audibly upon his stupidity when a too-vigorous
twist of the wrist sent the fly into a sapling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
from which he extricated it with the greatest
difficulty.</p>

<p>He was not of her world, Nan reflected, peering
at him through the fringing willows. She knew most
of the young gentlemen who attended dances or
played tennis and golf at the Country Club, and he
was not of their species. Once in making a long cast
his foot slipped, and he capered wildly while regaining
his balance, fell astraddle of the log, and one
shoe shipped water. He glanced about to make
sure this misfortune had not been observed, shook
the water out of his shoe and lighted a fresh
cigarette.</p>

<p>She admired the dexterity with which he held the
rod under his arm, manipulated the &#8220;makings&#8221;
and had the little cylinder burning in a jiffy and
hanging to his lip&mdash;a fashion of carrying a cigarette
not affected by the young gentlemen she knew.
It was just a little rakish; but he was, she surmised,
a rather rakish young man. A gray cap tilted over
one ear exaggerated his youthful appearance; his
countenance was still round and boyish, though she
judged him to be older than herself.</p>

<p>The patience and industry with which he plied
the rod were admirable: though there was not the
slightest probability that a fish would snap at the
fly, he continued his futile casting with the utmost
zeal and good humor. His sinewy arms were white&mdash;which,
being interpreted, meant that their exposure
to the sun had not been as constant as might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
be expected of one who was lord of his own time
and devoted to athletics. She was wondering
whether he intended to continue his exercise indefinitely,
when his efforts to extricate the fly from
a tangle of water-grass freed it unexpectedly, and
the line described a semicircle and caught a limb of
the sycamore under which she was lying.</p>

<p>His vigorous tugs only tightened it the more, and
she began speculating as to whether she should
rise and loosen it or await his own solution of the
difficulty. If it became necessary for him to leave the
fallen tree to effect a rescue, he must find her hiding-place;
and her dignity, she argued, would suffer
if she allowed him to discover that she had been
watching him. He now began moving toward the
bank with the becoming air of determination that
had attended his practice with the rod. She rose
quickly, jumped up and caught the bough that
held the fly, and tore it loose with a handful of
leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lordy!&#8221; he exclaimed, staring hard. &#8220;Did you
buy a ticket for this show, or did you stroll in on
a rain-check?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was here first; but it isn&#8217;t my river!&#8221;
she replied easily. &#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to be biting
very well,&#8221; she added consolingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Biting? Well, I should say not! There hasn&#8217;t
been a minnow in this river since the Indians left.
I&#8217;m just practicing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a lot of it,&#8221; said Nan, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
about for her hat and picking it up as an earnest
of her immediate departure.</p>

<p>He dropped his rod and walked toward her
guardedly and with an assumed carelessness, his
hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one good thing about fly-fishing,&#8221; he observed
detainingly; &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to bother
about the fish so long as there&#8217;s plenty of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>He noted the handkerchief that she had spread on
a bush to dry, and eyed her with appreciation as
she thrust the pins through her hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Country Club?&#8221; he asked casually.</p>

<p>She nodded affirmatively, glancing toward the
red roof of the clubhouse, and brushed the bits of
bark and earth from her skirt. If he meant to
annoy her with further conversation, it might be
just as well to make it clear that the club afforded
an easily accessible refuge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, but you&#8217;re Miss Farley,&mdash;yes? It&#8217;s
kind o&#8217; funny,&#8221; he continued, still lounging toward
her, &#8220;but I remember you away back when we were
both kids&mdash;my name being Amidon&mdash;Jeremiah
A., late of good old Perry County on La Belle
Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;and I&#8217;ve seen you lots o&#8217; times downtown.
I&#8217;m connected in a minor capacity with the
well-known house of Copeland-Farley Company,
drugs, wholesale only&mdash;naturally sort o&#8217; take an
interest in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was still wholly possible for her to walk away
without replying; and yet his slangy speech amused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
her, and his manner was deferential. She remembered
the Amidons from her childhood at Belleville,
on the Ohio, and she even vaguely remembered the
boy this young man must have been. Within three
yards of her he paused, as though to reassure her
that he was not disposed to presume upon an acquaintance
that rested flimsily upon knowledge
that might have awakened unwelcome memories;
and seeing that she hesitated, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good deal has happened since you sat in front
of me in the public school down there. I guess a
good deal has happened to both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too intimate for immediate acceptance;
but she would at least show him that whatever
changes might have taken place in their affairs, she
was not a snob.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Jerry; the other Amidon boy was Obadiah.
I remember him because the name always
seemed so funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re playing safe! Obey died when he was
ten&mdash;poor little kid! Scarlet fever. That was right
after the flood you floated away on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She murmured her regret at the death of his
brother. It was, however, still a delicate question
just how much weight should be given to these slight
ties of their common youth.</p>

<p>The disagreeable connotations of his introduction&mdash;the
southward-looking vista that led back
to the poverty and squalor to which she was born&mdash;were
rather rosily obscured by the atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of assured blitheness he exhaled. He seemed to
imply that both had put Belleville behind them
and that there was nothing surprising in this meeting
under happier conditions. He was a clean-cut,
well-knit, resolute young fellow. His brownish
hair was combed back from his forehead with an
onion-skin smoothness; indeed, he imparted a general
impression of smoothness. His gray eyes expressed
a juvenile innocence; his occasional smile
was a slow, reluctant grin that disclosed white, even
teeth. A self-confident young fellow, a trifle fresh,
and yet with an unobtrusive freshness that was not
displeasing, Nan thought, as she continued to observe
and appraise him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I broke away from the home-plate when I was
sixteen,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;about four years after you
pulled out; and I&#8217;ve been engaged in commercial
pursuits in this very town ever since. Arrived in a
freight-car,&#8221; he amplified cheerfully, as though she
were entitled to all the facts. &#8220;Got a job with the
aforesaid well-known jobbing house. Began by
sweeping out, and now I swing a sample-case down
the lower Wabash. Oh, not vulgarly rich! but I
manage to get my laundry out every Saturday
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You travel for the house, do you?&#8221; she asked
with a frown of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s calling it by a large name; but I can&#8217;t
deny that your words give me pleasure. They&#8217;re
just trying me out; it&#8217;s up to me to make good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
I&#8217;ve seen you in the office now and then; but you
never knew me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever saw you, I didn&#8217;t know you, of course,&#8221;
she said with unaffected sincerity; &#8220;if I had, I
should have spoken to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I never worried about that! But of course
it would be all right if you didn&#8217;t want to remember
me. I was an ugly little one-gallus kid with a frowsy
head and freckled face. I shouldn&#8217;t expect you to
remember me for my youthful beauty; but you
saved me from starvation once; I sat on your fence
and watched you eat a large red apple, and traded
you my only agate&mdash;it was an imitation&mdash;for the
core.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, declaring that she could never have
been so grasping, and he decided that she was a
good fellow. Her manner of ignoring the social
chasm that yawned between members of the fashionable
Country Club and the Little Ripple Club
farther down the river, to which young men who
invaded the lower Wabash with sample-cases were
acceptable, was wholly in her favor. Her parents
had been much poorer than his own: his father had
been a teamster; hers had been a common day
laborer and a poor stick at that. And recurring to
the maternal line, her mother had without shame
added to the uncertain family income by taking in
washing. His mother, on the other hand, had
canned her own fruit and been active in the affairs
of the First M.E. Church, serving on committees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
with the wives of men who owned stores and were
therefore of Belleville&#8217;s aristocracy; she had even
been invited to the parsonage to supper.</p>

<p>If Nan Corrigan&#8217;s parents had not perished in an
Ohio River flood, and if Timothy Farley, serving on
a flood sufferers&#8217; relief committee, had not rescued
her from a shanty that was about to topple over by
the angry waters, Nan Farley would not be standing
there in expensive raiment talking to Jerry Amidon.
These facts were not to be ignored and she
was conscious of no wish to ignore them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been fortunate, of course,&#8221; she said, as
though condensing an answer to many questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s a good deal in luck,&#8221; he replied
easily. &#8220;If one of our best tie-hoppers hadn&#8217;t got
killed in a trolley smash-up, I might never have got
a chance to try the road. I&#8217;d probably have been
doing Old Masters with the marking-pot around
the shipping-room to the end of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>His way of putting things amused her, and her
smile heightened his admiration of her dimples.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re going fishing when you learn
how to manage the fly?&#8221; she asked, willing to prolong
the talk now that they had disposed of the
past.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never spoke truer words! It&#8217;s this way,&#8221;
he continued confidentially: &#8220;When I see a fellow
doing something I don&#8217;t know how to do, my heart-action
isn&#8217;t good till I learn the trick. It used to
make me sick to have to watch &#8217;em marking boxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
at the store, and I began getting down at six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
to practice, so when a chance came along I&#8217;d be
ready to handle the brush. And camping once over
Sunday a few miles down this romantic stretch of
sandbars, I saw a chap hook a bass with a hand-made
fly instead of a worm, and I&#8217;ve been waiting
until returning prosperity gave me the price of a
box of those toys to try it myself. And here you&#8217;ve
caught me in the act. But don&#8217;t give me away to
the sports up there.&#8221; He indicated the clubhouse
with a jerk of the head. &#8220;It might injure my credit
on the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll not give you away!&#8221; she replied in his
own key. &#8220;But did the man you saw catch the fish
that time ever enter more fully into your life? I
should think he ought to have known how highly
you approved of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I got acquainted with him after that, and
he&#8217;s taken quite a shine to me, if I may say it which
shouldn&#8217;t. The name being Eaton&mdash;John Cecil&mdash;lawyer
by trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face expressed surprise; then she laughed
merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s never taken a shine to me; I think he disapproves
of me. If he doesn&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;she frowned&mdash;&#8220;he
ought to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing like that!&#8221; he declared with his
peculiar slangy intonation. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t half as frosty
as he looks; he&#8217;s the greatest ever; says he believes
he could have made something out of me if he&#8217;d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
caught me sooner. He works at it occasionally, anyway;
trying to purify my grammar&mdash;a hard job;
says my slang is picturesque and useful for commercial
purposes, but little adapted to the politer
demands of the drawing-room. You know how
Cecil talks? He&#8217;s a grand talker&mdash;sort o&#8217; guys you,
and you can&#8217;t get mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed that,&#8221; said Nan, with a rueful
smile. &#8220;You ought to be proud that he takes an
interest in you. I suppose it&#8217;s your sense of humor;
he&#8217;s strong for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>This compliment, ventured cautiously, clearly
pleased Amidon. He stooped, picked up a pebble
and sent it skimming over the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says a sense of humor is essential to one who
gropes for the philosophy of life&mdash;his very words.
I don&#8217;t know what it means, but he says if I&#8217;m
good and quit opening all my remarks with &#8216;Listen,&#8217;
he&#8217;ll elucidate some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her curiosity was aroused. The social conjunction
of John Cecil Eaton and Jeremiah A. Amidon
was bewildering.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not in the habit of wasting time on people
he doesn&#8217;t like&mdash;me, for example,&#8221; she remarked,
lifting her handkerchief from the bush and shaking
it out. &#8220;I suppose you met him in a business way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much! Politics! I room in his ward, and we
met in the Fourth Ward Democratic Club. He
tried to smash the Machine in the primary last
spring, and I helped clean him up&mdash;some job, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
can tell you! But he&#8217;s a good loser, and he says it&#8217;s
his duty to win me over to the Cause of Righteousness.
Cecil&#8217;s a thinker, all right. He says thought
isn&#8217;t regarded as highly nowadays as it used to be;
says my feet are well trained now, and I ought to
begin using my head. He always wears that solemn
front, and you never know when to laugh. Just
toys with his funny whiskers and never blinks.
Says he tries his jokes on me before he springs &#8217;em
at the University Club. I just let him string me;
in fact, I&#8217;ve got to; he says I need his chastening
hand. Gave me a copy of the Bible, Christmas, and
told me to learn the Ten Commandments; said
they were going out of fashion pretty fast, and he
thought I could build up a reputation for being
eccentric by living up to &#8217;em. Says if Moses had
made eleven, he couldn&#8217;t have improved on the
job any. Queer way of talking religion, but Cecil&#8217;s
different, any way you look at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>These revelations as to John Cecil Eaton&#8217;s admiration
for the Ten Commandments, coming from
Amidon, were surprising, but not so puzzling as the
evident fact that Eaton found Copeland-Farley&#8217;s
young commercial traveler worth cultivating.
Amidon was quick to see that he rose in Nan&#8217;s estimation
by reason of Eaton&#8217;s friendly interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never get on with him,&#8221; she confessed,
willing to sacrifice herself that Amidon might plume
himself the more upon Eaton&#8217;s partiality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, I don&#8217;t <i>understand</i> him!&#8221; Amidon protested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
&#8220;If I was smart enough to do that, I
wouldn&#8217;t be working for eighteen per. I guess he
just gets lonesome sometimes and looks me up
to have somebody to talk to&mdash;not that <i>anybody</i>
wouldn&#8217;t be tickled to hear him, but he says he
finds in me a certain raciness and tang of the
Hoosier soil&mdash;whatever that means. He took me
over to the Art Institute last Sunday and gave me
a lecture on the pictures, and me not understanding
any more than if he&#8217;d been talking Chinese. Introduced
me to a Frenchman fresh from Paris and
told him my ideals were distinctly post-impressionistic.
Then we bumped into a college professor, and
he made me talk so the guy could note the mellow
flavor of my idiom. Can you beat that? Cecil says
the hostility of the social classes to each other is
preposterous. Got me to take him to a dance the
freight-handlers were throwing. It was funny, but
they all warmed to him like flies to a leaky sugar-barrel.
Wore his evening clothes, white vest and
all, and he was the only guy there in an ironed
shirt! I thought they&#8217;d sure kill him; but not on
your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>The John Cecil Eaton thus limned was not the
austere person Nan knew. Her Eaton was a sedate
gentleman who made cryptic remarks to her at
parties and was known to be exceedingly conservative
in social matters. Amidon, she surmised, was
far too keen to subject himself unwillingly to
Eaton&#8217;s caustic humor, nor was Eaton a man to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
trouble himself with any one unless he received an
adequate return.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be going back,&#8221; she said, glancing at her
watch. Her casual manner of consulting the pretty
trinket on her wrist charmed him. He was pleased
with himself that he had been able to carry through
an interview with so superior a person.</p>

<p>He had never been more at ease in his most brilliant
conversations with the prettiest stenographer
in the drug house, whose sole aim in life seemed to
be to &#8220;call him down&#8221; for his freshness. Lunch-counter
girls, shop-girls, attractive motion-picture
cashiers, were an alluring target for his wit, and the
more cruelly they snubbed him the more intensely
he admired them. But the stimulus of these adventures
was not comparable to the exaltation he experienced
from this encounter with Nan Farley. If
she had pretended not to remember him he would
have hated her cordially; as it was, he liked her immensely.
Though she lacked the pert &#8220;come-back&#8221;
of girls behind desks and counters, he felt, nevertheless,
that she would give a good account of herself
in like positions if exposed to the bold raillery of
commercial travelers. He was humble before her
kindness. She turned away, hesitated an instant,
then took a step toward him and put out her hand.
There was something of appeal in the look she gave
him as their hands touched&mdash;the vaguest hint of an
appeal. Her eyes narrowed for an instant with the
intentness of her gaze as she searched his face for&mdash;sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
understanding, confidence. Then she
withdrew her hand quickly, aware that his admiration
was expressing itself with disconcerting frankness
in his friendly gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been nice to see you again,&#8221; she said
softly. &#8220;Good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to you, Miss Farley; I hope to meet
you again sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; I hope so too.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded brightly and moved off along the
path toward the clubhouse. He felt absently for his
book of cigarette-papers as he reviewed what she
had said and what he had said.</p>

<p>He did not resume his whipping of the river, but
restored his rod to its case and turned slowly downstream,
not neglecting to lift his eyes to the clubhouse
as he drifted by.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE AFFAIRS OF MRS. COPELAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a quiet corner of the club veranda Fanny
Copeland and John Cecil Eaton had been conscious
of the noisy gayety of Mrs. Kinney&#8217;s party, and
they observed Nan Farley&#8217;s hurried exit and disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan doesn&#8217;t seem to be responding to encores,&#8221;
Eaton remarked. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone off to sulk&mdash;bored,
probably; prefers to be alone, poor kid! It&#8217;s outrageous
the way those people use her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have to be amused,&#8221; replied Mrs. Copeland,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve heard that Nan can be very funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are all kinds of fun,&#8221; Eaton assented
dryly. &#8220;She&#8217;s been taking off Uncle Tim again. I
don&#8217;t see that he&#8217;s getting anything for his money&mdash;that
is, assuming that she gets his money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland quickly,
&#8220;she won&#8217;t be the only person that&#8217;s disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton lifted his eyes toward a stretch of woodland
beyond the river and regarded it fixedly. Then
his gaze reverted to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think Billy wants to get back the money
he paid Farley for the drug business?&#8221; he asked, in
a colorless, indifferent tone that was habitual.</p>

<p>John Cecil Eaton was nearing the end of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
thirties&mdash;tall, lean, with a closely trimmed black
beard. He was dressed for the links, and his waiting
caddy was guarding his bag in the distance and
incidentally experimenting at clock golf. Eaton&#8217;s
long fingers were clasped round his head in such
manner as to set his cap awry. One was conscious
of the deliberate gaze of his eyes; his drawling
voice and dry humor suggested a man of leisurely
habits. He specialized in patent law&mdash;that is to
say, having a small but certain income, he was able
to discriminate in his choice of cases, and he accepted
only those that particularly interested him.
He had been educated as a mechanical engineer,
and the law was an afterthought. His years at Exeter
and the Tech, prolonged by his law course at
Harvard, had quickened his speech and modified
its Hoosier flavor. He passed for an Eastern man
with strangers. He was the fourth of his name in
the community, and it was a name, distinguished
in war and peace, that was well sprinkled through
the pages of Indiana history. Though the Eatons
had rendered public service in conspicuous instances
they had never been money-makers, and
when John heard of the high prices attained by
Washington Street property in the early years of
the twentieth century he reflected that if his father
and grandfather had been a little more sanguine as
to the city&#8217;s future he might have been the richest
man in town.</p>

<p>Eaton&#8217;s interests were not all confined to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
profession. He read prodigiously in many fields;
he observed politics closely and was president of a
club that debated economic and social questions;
he was the best fly-fisherman in the State. His
occasional efforts to improve the tone of local politics
greatly amused his friends, who could not see
why a man who might have been pardoned for
looking enviously upon a seat in the United States
Senate should subject himself to the indignity of a
defeat for the city council. To the men he lunched
with daily at the University Club his interest in
municipal affairs was only another of his eccentricities.
He had never married, but was still carried
hopefully on the list of eligibles. By general consent
he was the best dinner man in town&mdash;a guest who
could be relied upon to keep the talk going and
make a favorable impression on pilgrims from
abroad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s ironic smile at his last remark
had lingered. Their eyes met glancingly; then the
gaze of both fell upon the distant treetops. Theirs
was an old friendship that rendered unnecessary the
filling in of gaps. Eaton was thinking less concretely
of her reference to Billy Copeland&#8217;s designs upon
the Farley money than of the abstract fact that a
divorced woman might sit upon a club veranda and
hear her former spouse&#8217;s voice raised in joyous exclamation
within, and even revert without visible
emotion to the possibility of his remarrying.</p>

<p>Times and standards had changed. This was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
longer the sober capital it had been, where every
one went to church, and particular merit might be
acquired by attending prayer-meeting. It was a
very different place from what it had been in days
well within Eaton&#8217;s recollection, before the bobtail
mule cars yielded to the trolley, or the automobile
drove out the sober-going pha&euml;tons and
station-wagons that had satisfied the native longing
for grandeur. The roster of the Country Club
bore testimony of the passing of the old order. The
membership committee no longer concerned itself
with the ancestry or reputation for sobriety of
applicants, or their place of worship, or whether
their grandfathers had come to town before the
burning of the Morrison Opera House, or even
the later conflagration that consumed the Academy
of Music. You might speak of late arrivals like the
Kinneys with all the scorn you pleased, but they
had been recognized by everybody but a few ultra-conservatives;
and if Bob Kinney was something of
a sport or his wife&#8217;s New York clothes were a trifle
daring for the local taste, such criticisms did not
weigh heavily as against the handsome villa in
which these same Kinneys had established themselves
in the new residential area on the river bluff.
Curiosity is a stern foe of snobbishness; and when
Mrs. Kinney seemed so &#8220;sweet&#8221; and had given a
thousand dollars to the new Girls&#8217; Club, besides
endowing a children&#8217;s room in the Presbyterian
Hospital, many very proper and dignified matrons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
felt fully justified in crossing the Rubicon (otherwise
White River) for an inspection of Mrs.
Kinney&#8217;s new house. Eaton had accepted such
things in a philosophic spirit, just as he accepted
Kinney&#8217;s retainer to safeguard the patents on the
devices that made Kinney&#8217;s cement the best on the
market and the only brand that would take the
finish and tint of tile or marble.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be understood that they&#8217;re waiting
for Farley to die so they can be married comfortably,&#8221;
Eaton remarked. &#8220;But Farley&#8217;s a tough
old hickory knot. He&#8217;s capable of hanging on just
to spite them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was always very kind to me. I saw a good
deal of him and his wife after I came here. He was
proud of the business and anxious that Billy should
carry it on and keep developing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always liked the steamboating period of Farley&#8217;s life,&#8221;
said Eaton, ignoring this frank reference
to her former husband, in which he thought he detected
a trace of wistfulness; &#8220;and he&#8217;s told me a
good deal about it at times. It was much more
picturesque than his wholesale-drugging. He never
quite got over his river days&mdash;he&#8217;s always been
the second mate, bullying the roustabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never forgot how to swear,&#8221; Mrs. Copeland
laughed. &#8220;He does it adorably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was never anything like him when he&#8217;s
well heated,&#8221; Eaton continued. &#8220;He never means
anything&mdash;it&#8217;s just his natural way of talking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
His customers rather liked it on the whole&mdash;expected
him to commit them to the fiery pit every
time they came to town and dropped in to see him.
When he got stung in a trade&mdash;which wasn&#8217;t
often&mdash;he&#8217;d go into his room and lock the door
and curse himself for an hour or two and then go
out and raise somebody&#8217;s wages. A character&mdash;a
real person, old Uncle Tim!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought of the retired merchant seemed to
give Eaton pleasure; a smile played furtively about
his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must have been his wife who used to
lure him to church every Sunday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it! It was the old man himself. He
had a superstitious feeling that business would go
badly if he cut church. He never swore on Sundays,
but made up for it Monday mornings. He&#8217;s always
been a generous backer of foreign missionaries
on the theory that by Christianizing the heathen
we&#8217;re widening the market for American commerce.
We&#8217;ve had worse men than Farley. I suppose he
never told a lie or did an underhanded thing through
all the years he was in business. And all he has to
leave behind him is his half million or more&mdash;and
Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Nan,&#8221; Mrs. Copeland repeated with a
shrug of her shoulders. &#8220;I suppose Mr. Farley
knows what&#8217;s up. He&#8217;s too shrewd not to know.
Clever as Nan is, she could hardly pull the wool
over his eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s much too clever not to know she can&#8217;t
fool him; but he&#8217;s immensely fond of her, just as
his wife was. And we&#8217;ve got to admit that Nan is a
very charming person&mdash;a little devilish, but keen
and amusing. She&#8217;s too good for that crowd she&#8217;s
running with&mdash;no doubt of that! If Uncle Tim
thought she meant to marry Billy, he would take
pains to see that she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean he wouldn&#8217;t leave her the money?&#8221;
she asked in a lower tone. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;d have
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s under no obligation to give it all to Nan.
If he thought there was any chance of her marrying
Billy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been led to believe that it would all be
hers. The Farleys educated her and brought her up
in a way to encourage the belief. It would be cruel
to disappoint her; he wouldn&#8217;t have any right to
cut her off,&#8221; Mrs. Copeland concluded with feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be less cruel to cut her off than to let
her have it all and go on the way she&#8217;s started. She
came about ten years too late upon the scene. It&#8217;s
only within a few years that a party like we&#8217;ve listened
to in there would have been possible in this
town. If Nan had reached her twentieth year a
decade ago, she&#8217;d have been the demurest of little
girls, and there would have been no question of her
marrying a man who had divorced his wife merely
to be free to appropriate her.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;A VERY CHARMING PERSON&mdash;A LITTLE DEVILISH,<br />
BUT KEEN AND AMUSING&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Mrs. Copeland opened and closed her eyes
quickly several times. No other man of her acquaintance
would have dared to speak of her personal
affairs in this blunt fashion. Eaton had referred to
the divorce that had severed her ties with Copeland
quite as though she were not an interested
party to that transaction. He now went a step
further, and the color deepened in her face as he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why you didn&#8217;t resist his
suit. I&#8217;ve never said this to you before, and it&#8217;s
too late to be proffering advice, but you oughtn&#8217;t
to have let it go as you did. Billy&#8217;s whole conduct
was perfectly contemptible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no sense in making a fight if he
wanted to quit. The law couldn&#8217;t widen the breach;
it was there anyhow, from the first moment I knew
what was in his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He acted like a scoundrel,&#8221; persisted Eaton in
his cool, even tones; &#8220;it was base, rotten, damnable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated and frowned&mdash;&#8220;if
you mean that he let the impression get abroad
that I was at fault&mdash;that it was I who had become
interested elsewhere&mdash;it&#8217;s only just to say that I
never thought Billy did that. I don&#8217;t believe now
that he did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was aware that he had ventured far toward
the red lamps of danger. This matter of her personal
honor was too delicate for veranda discussion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
in fact, it was not a matter that he had any right
to refer to even remotely at any time or place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, unpleasant things were said,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;I suppose they&#8217;re always bound to be.
Manning was his friend, not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton received this impassively, which was his
way of receiving most things.</p>

<p>&#8220;By keeping out of the way, that gentleman
proved that he couldn&#8217;t have been any friend of
yours. If he&#8217;d been a gentleman or even a man&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke in upon him quietly, bending toward
him with tense eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He offered to: I have never told that to any one,
but I don&#8217;t want you to be unfair even to him. My
mistake was that I meekly followed Billy when he
began running with the new crowd. I knew I was
boring him, and I thought if I took up with the
Kinneys and the people they were training with,
he might get tired of them after a while and we
could go on as we had begun. But I hadn&#8217;t reckoned
with Nan. I allowed myself to be put in competition
with a girl of twenty&mdash;which is a foolish
thing for a woman of thirty-five to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She carried lightly the thirty-five years to which
she confessed, but sometimes, in unguarded moments,
a startled, pained look stole into her brown
eyes, as though at the remembrance of a blow that
might repeat itself. There was a patch of white in
her hair just at one side of her forehead. Its effect
was to contribute to her natural air of distinction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
She was of medium height and her trim figure retained
its girlish lines. Her face and hands were
tanned brown, and the color was becoming. She
wore to-day a blue skirt and a plain blouse, with a
soft collar opened at the throat. She had walked
to the clubhouse from her home, a mile distant, and
her meeting with Eaton had been purely incidental.
After her divorce she had established herself as a
dairy farmer on twenty acres of land that she had
inherited from her father, a banker in one of the
smaller county seats, who had been specially interested
in dairying and had encouraged her interest
in the diversion he made profitable. To please
him she had taken a course in dairying at the State
Agricultural School and knew the business in all its
practical aspects. Copeland had first seen her at a
winter resort in Florida where she had gone with
her father in his last illness, and their common ties
with Indiana had made it easily possible for him
to cultivate her better acquaintance later at home.
Billy Copeland was an attractive young fellow with
good prospects; his social experience was much
ampler than hers, and the marriage seemed to her
friends an advantageous one. When after ten years
she found herself free, she rose from the ruins of her
domestic happiness determined to live her life in
the way that pleased her best. She shrank from adjusting
herself to a new groove in town; the plight
of the divorced woman was still, in this community,
not wholly comfortable. There was little consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
in the sympathy of friends&mdash;though she had
many; and even the general attitude, that Copeland&#8217;s
conduct was utterly indefensible, did not
help greatly. She realized perfectly that in following
Copeland&#8217;s lead unprotestingly when he caught
step with the quicker social pace set by the Kinneys,&mdash;a
name that stood as a synonym for noiser functions
and heavier libations than the community had
tolerated,&mdash;she had estranged many who were
affronted by the violence with which the town was
becoming kinneyized.</p>

<p>Two years had passed and her broken wings
again beat the air with something of their early
rhythm. The pathos of her isolation was more apparent
to her old friends in town than to herself.
Whether she had dropped out of the Kinney crowd,
or whether it was more properly an ejectment, there
was all the more reason why women who had regarded
the intrusions of that set with horror should
manifest their confidence in her. If she had been
poor, a <i>divorc&eacute;e</i> lodged in a boarding-house and in
need of practical aid, she might have suffered from
neglect; but having an assured small income which
her investment in the dairy farm in no wise jeopardized,
it was rather the thing to look in on her
occasionally. Young girls in particular thought her
handsome and interesting-looking, and risked their
mothers&#8217; displeasure by going to see her. And there
were women who sought her out merely to emphasize
their disapproval of Copeland and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
scandal of his divorce, which they felt to be an affront
to the community&#8217;s dignity in a man whose father
had been of the old order of decent, law-abiding,
home-keeping, church-going citizens. They admired
the courage and dignity with which she met
misfortune and addressed herself uncomplainingly
to the business of fashioning a new life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been keeping you from your game,&#8221; she
said, rising abruptly; &#8220;and I must be getting home.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked down the veranda toward the entrance
and reached the door at a moment when
Copeland, who had been keeping company with a
tall glass in the rathskeller below, waiting impatiently
for Nan&#8217;s return, lounged out.</p>

<p>He stopped short with a slightly challenging air.
Eaton bowed and tugged at the visor of his cap.
Copeland lifted his straw hat and muttered a good-afternoon
that was intended for one or both as they
chose to take it. Mrs. Copeland glanced at him
without making any sign; she did not speak to
Eaton again, but as they parted near the first tee
and she started across the links toward the highway,
she nodded quickly and smiled a forlorn little
smile that haunted him for some time afterward.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, standing erect after successfully
negotiating a difficult putt, he said, under his breath:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! She&#8217;s still in love with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced around to make sure no one had overheard
him, and crossed to the next tee with a look
of deep perplexity on his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Nan, having returned to the clubhouse, sauntered
down the veranda toward Copeland, wearing a demure
air she had practiced for his benefit. Her
indifference to his annoyance at her long absence
added to his vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you been up to?&#8221; he demanded
irritably. &#8220;The others skipped long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was tired and went down to the river to
rest. I&#8217;m going home now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go home; Grace expects us to stop
at her house; they&#8217;ll all be there in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I must skip. You run along like a
good boy, and I&#8217;ll hop on the trolley. I must be
home by five, and I&#8217;ll just about make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not treating Grace right, to say nothing
of me!&#8221; he expostulated. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting sick of all
this dodging and ducking. I&#8217;m coming up to the
house to-morrow and have it out with Farley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice boy, Billy, but you&#8217;re not going
to do anything foolish,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>He found the kindness of this&mdash;even its note of
fondness&mdash;unsatisfying. He read into it a skepticism
that was not flattering.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been fooling long enough about this;
we&#8217;ve got to announce our engagement and be
done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Billy, we&#8217;re not engaged! We&#8217;re just the
best of friends. Why should we stir up a big fuss
by getting engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s got into you, anyhow!&#8221; he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
eyeing her angrily. &#8220;This talk about not being
engaged doesn&#8217;t go! I&#8217;m getting tired of all this
nonsense&mdash;being kicked about and held off when
I&#8217;ve staked everything I&#8217;ve got on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; she said steadily, &#8220;that you divorced
your wife, thinking I would marry you; and
now you&#8217;re angry because I&#8217;m not in a hurry about
it, and don&#8217;t want to trouble papa, who has been
kinder to me than anybody else ever was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t cry here! We&#8217;ve been
talked about enough; I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s
got into you to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just mean to be sensible, that&#8217;s all. We&#8217;ve
had some mighty fine times, and you&#8217;ve been nice
to me; but there&#8217;s no hurry about getting married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No hurry!&#8221; He stared at her, unable in his
impotent rage to deal with the situation as he
thought it deserved. &#8220;Look here, Nan, I can stand
a lot of this Irish temperament of yours, but you&#8217;re
playing it a little too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Irish temperament!&#8221; she repeated poutingly.
&#8220;Well, I guess the Irish is there all right; I
don&#8217;t know about the temperamental part of it.
A good many people call it something very different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When am I going to see you again?&#8221; he demanded
roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know! You see me now and you
don&#8217;t like me. You&#8217;d better go downtown and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
some work, Billy; that&#8217;s what I should prescribe
for you. And you&#8217;ve got to cut out the drink; it&#8217;s
getting too big a hold on you. I&#8217;m going to quit,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing near the entrance, they had been
obliged to acknowledge the greetings of a number of
new arrivals. It was manifestly no place for a prolonged
serious discussion of their future. Mrs.
Harrington, whose husband&#8217;s bank, the Ph&#339;nix
National, was the soundest in the State, climbed
the steps from her motor without seeing Nan and
her companion. Until Farley retired, the Copeland-Farley
account was carried by the Ph&#339;nix; when
Billy Copeland took the helm he transferred it to
the Western, as likely to grant a more generous
credit.</p>

<p>Copeland flushed angrily at the slight; Nan bit
her lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Be a good boy. I&#8217;ll see
you again in a day or two. And for Heaven&#8217;s sake,
don&#8217;t call me on the telephone; papa has an extension
in his room, you know, and hears everything.
Tell Grace I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me run you into town; I can set you down
somewhere near home. The trolleys are hot and
dusty. Besides, I want to talk to you; I&#8217;ve got a
lot to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day, Billy. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton found Nan waiting for him at the fourth
green.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;I was praying for a mascot, and here you are,&#8221;
he remarked affably. &#8220;I can&#8217;t fail to turn in a good
card. Glad to see you&#8217;ve taken up walking; there&#8217;s
nothing like it&mdash;particularly on a humid afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to disappoint you, but I hope to catch the
four-thirty for town. What are my chances?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent, if you don&#8217;t waste more than ten
minutes on me. You&#8217;ve never given me more than
five up to date. How is Mr. Farley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been very comfortable for a week; really
quite like himself. You&#8217;d better come and see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to drop in often all winter, but was
afraid of boring him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re one of the few that couldn&#8217;t do that.
He likes to talk to you. You don&#8217;t bother him with
questions about his health&mdash;a sure way of pleasing
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rare man, Farley. Wiser than serpents, and
stimulating. I&#8217;ve learned a good deal from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached his ball, that had accommodatingly
effected a good lie, and after viewing it with approval
he glanced at Nan and remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better urge me to come to see you, too.
It&#8217;s just occurred to me that it might be well for us
to know each other better. I may flatter myself;
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the nicest thing I&#8217;ve heard to-day!
Please come soon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Thank you, Nan; I shall certainly do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met a friend of yours a while ago,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;who pronounced you the greatest living man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! A gentleman, of course; I identify him at
once; he&#8217;s the only person alive I fool to that extent&mdash;Jeremiah
A. Amidon! I can&#8217;t imagine why he
hasn&#8217;t mentioned his acquaintance with you. I
shall chide him for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He viewed her in his quizzical fashion through
the thick-lensed spectacles he used for golfing. In
his ordinary occupations these gave place to eyeglasses
that twinkled with a sharp, hard brightness,
as though bent upon obscuring the kindness that
lay behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t seen him lately&mdash;not since I was a
child. We used to be neighbors when we were children,
and he was a very, very naughty boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say he was,&#8221; Eaton remarked, with his
air of thinking of something else. &#8220;I suppose you
didn&#8217;t find him at all backward in bringing himself
to your notice. Shyness isn&#8217;t his dominant
trait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, he was rather diffident and
wholly polite. I thought his manners did you
credit&mdash;for he said you had been coaching him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be chidden; his use of my name in that
connection is utterly unwarranted. He was one of
Mrs. Kinney&#8217;s party, I suppose,&mdash;very interesting.
I&#8217;m glad they have taken him up!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was watching, with the quick eagerness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
made him so disconcerting a companion, the passing
of a motor toward the clubhouse, but she understood
perfectly that this utterance had been with
ironic intent. She laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How funny you are! I wish I weren&#8217;t afraid
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a careful study of the phobias, and
there is nothing in the best authorities to justify a
fear of me. I&#8217;m as tame as buttered toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s clear Mr. Amidon isn&#8217;t afraid of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m relieved&mdash;infinitely; I&#8217;m in mortal terror
of <i>him</i>. He&#8217;s fixed standards of conduct for me that
make me nervous. I&#8217;m afraid the young scoundrel
will catch me with my visor down some day; then
smash goes his poor idol. I&#8217;m glad you spoke of
him; if he wasn&#8217;t at your luncheon&mdash;a guess
you scorned to notice&mdash;I suppose you met by
chance, the usual way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just like that,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Very
much so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! I warn you against accepting the attentions
of just any young man who strolls up the
river. A girl of your years must be discreet. Your
early knowledge of Mr. Amidon in the loved spots
your infancy knew won&#8217;t save you. You&#8217;d better
refer all such matters to me. Pleasant as this is,
you&#8217;re going to miss your car if you don&#8217;t rustle.
And Harrington&#8217;s bawling his head off trying to
fore me away. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>With a neat stroke he landed his ball on the
green and ran after it to raise the blockade. When
Nan had halted the car and climbed into the vestibule,
she waved her hand, a salute which he returned
gallantly with a sweep of his cap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>MR. FARLEY BECOMES EXPLICIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Farleys had lived for twenty years in an old-fashioned
square brick house surrounded by maples.
The lower floor comprised a parlor, sitting-room,
and dining-room, with a library on the side. The
library had been Farley&#8217;s den, where he smoked his
pipe and read his newspapers. The bookcases that
lined the walls had rarely been opened; they contained
the &#8220;Waverley Novels,&#8221; Dickens&#8217;s &#8220;Works&#8221;
complete, and a wide range of miscellaneous fiction,
including &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,&#8221; most of Mark
Twain, Tourg&eacute;e&#8217;s novel of Reconstruction, &#8220;A
Fool&#8217;s Errand,&#8221; Helen Hunt Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Ramona,&#8221;
and a number of Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney&#8217;s stories
for girls&mdash;these latter reminiscent of Nan&#8217;s girlhood.
The brown volumes of &#8220;Messages and
Papers of the Presidents&#8221; were massed on the bottom
shelves invincibly with half a dozen &#8220;Reports&#8221;
of the State Geological Survey. The doors of the
black-walnut bookcases were warped so that the
contents were accessible only after patient tugging.
Half the books were upside-down&mdash;and had been
since the last house-cleaning. The room presented
an inhospitable front to literature, and the other
arts fared no better elsewhere in the house. A steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
engraving of the Parthenon on the dining-room wall
confronted a crude print of the <span class="smcap">Jane E. Newcomb</span>,
an Ohio River packet on which Farley had been
second mate&mdash;and an efficient one&mdash;in &#8217;69-&#8217;70.</p>

<p>Mrs. Farley had established in her household
the Southwestern custom of abating the heat by
keeping the outer shutters closed through the
middle of the day, and the negro servants who still
continued in charge had not changed her system in
this or in any other important particular. Nan had
not lacked instruction in the domestic arts; in her
school vacations she had been thoroughly drilled
by Mrs. Farley. Cleanliness in its traditional relationship
to godliness had been deeply impressed
upon her; and she had been taught to sew, knit,
and crochet. She knew how to cook after the plain
fashion to which Mrs. Farley&#8217;s tastes and experience
limited her; she had belonged to an embroidery
class formed to give occupation to one of Mrs.
Farley&#8217;s friends who had fallen upon evil times;
and Nan had been the aptest of pupils.</p>

<p>But Nan had never been equal to the task of
initiating changes in the Farley household, with its
regular order of sweepings, scrubbings, and dustings;
its special days for baking, its inexorable rotation
in meats and vegetables for the table. And if
she had needed justification she would have given
as her excuse Farley&#8217;s long acceptance of his wife&#8217;s
domestic routine, and the fear of displeasing him
by altering it. The colored cook&#8217;s husband did the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
heavier indoor cleaning and maintained the yard;
and the dining-room and the upper floor were cared
for by a colored woman. Hardly any one employed
a black second girl, and Nan would have changed
the color scheme in this particular and substituted a
neatly capped and aproned white girl of the type
that opened the door of her friends&#8217; houses, but the
present incumbent was a niece of the cook and not
to be eliminated without rending the entire domestic
fabric.</p>

<p>Nan reached home a few minutes after five.
She ran upstairs and found Farley in his room,
bending over a table by the window playing solitaire.
The trained nurse who had been in the
house for a year appeared at the door and withdrew.
Nan crossed the room and laid a hand on
Farley&#8217;s shoulder. He had nearly finished the
game, and she remained quietly watching his tremulous
hands shifting the cards until he leaned back
with a little grunt of satisfaction at the end. He
put up his hand to hers and drew her round so that
he could look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still wearing that fool hat! Take it off and sit
down here and talk to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His small, round head was thickly covered with
stiff white hair, though his square-cut beard had
whitened unevenly and still showed traces of brown.
While he lay in the chair with a pathetic inertness,
his eyes moved about restlessly, and his bleached,
gnarled fingers were never wholly quiet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what you&#8217;ve been up to to-day?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamie Pembroke&#8217;s; she was having a luncheon
for her cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just girls, I suppose?&#8221; he asked indifferently.
&#8220;You must have had a lot to eat to be gone all
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we went for a motor run afterward and
stopped at the Country Club on the way back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More to eat, I suppose. My God! everybody
seems able to eat but me! I told that fool doctor
awhile ago I was goin&#8217; to shoot him if he didn&#8217;t cut
off this gruel he&#8217;s feedin&#8217; me. You can lay in corn&#8217;
beef and cabbage for to-morrow; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to eat a
barrel of it, too. If I can get hold of some real food
for a week, I&#8217;ll get out of this. I understand they&#8217;ve
got Bill Harrington playin&#8217; golf. My God! he&#8217;s two
years older than I am and sits on his job every day.
If I&#8217;d never knuckled under to the doctors, I&#8217;d be
a well man!&#8221; The wind rustling the maple by the
nearest window attracted his attention. &#8220;Open
that blind, and let the air in. Things have come to
a nice pass when a man with my constitution can
be shut up in a dark room without air enough to
keep him alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was necessary to lift the wire screen before the
shutters could be opened, and he watched her intently
as she obeyed him quickly and quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been to luncheon, have you?&#8221; he remarked as
she sat down. &#8220;Well, eatin&#8217; your meals outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
doesn&#8217;t save me any money. Those damned niggers
cook just as much as if they had a regiment in
the house. What did they give you to eat at the
Pembrokes&#8217;&mdash;the usual bird-food rubbish?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before his illness he had scrupulously reserved his
profanity for business uses; and it was only when
his pain grew intolerable or the slow action of his
doctor&#8217;s remedies roused him to fury that he had
recourse to strong language. He allowed her to
change the position of his footstool, which had
slipped away from him, and grunted his appreciation
as he stretched his long, bony figure more comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on and tell me what you had to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed best to meet this demand in a spirit of
lightness. Having lied once, it might be well to
vary her recital by resorting to the truth, and she
counted off on her fingers, with the mockery that
he had always seemed to like, the items of food that
had really constituted Mrs. Kinney&#8217;s luncheon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grape-fruit, broiled chicken, asparagus, potatoes
baked in their jackets and sprinkled with red
pepper, the way you like them; romaine salad, ice-cream
and cake&mdash;just plain sponge cake&mdash;coffee.
Nothing so very sumptuous about that, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had always been &#8220;papa&#8221; and &#8220;mamma&#8221; since
her adoption. When she came home from a boarding-school
near Philadelphia where she had spent
two years, her attempts to change the provincial
&#8220;poppa&#8221; and &#8220;momma&#8221; to the French pronunciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
had been promptly thwarted. Farley hated
anything that seemed &#8220;high-falutin&#8217;&#8221;; and having
grown used to being called &#8220;poppa,&#8221; his heart was
as flint against the impious substitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there were no cocktails or champagne.
Not at the Pembrokes&#8217;! If all the women around
here were like Mrs. Pembroke, we wouldn&#8217;t have
nice little girls like you swillin&#8217; liquor; nor these sap-headed
boys that trot with you girls stewin&#8217; their
worthless little brains in gin. What do you think
these cigarette-smokin&#8217; swine are goin&#8217; to do! Do
you hear of &#8217;em doin&#8217; any work? Is there one of &#8217;em
that&#8217;s worth a dollar a week? My God! between
you girls runnin&#8217; around half-naked and these
worthless young cubs plantin&#8217; their weak, wobbly
little chins against cocktails all night, things have
come to a nice pass. Well, why don&#8217;t you go on and
tell me who was at your party? Here I am, lyin&#8217;
here waitin&#8217; for the pallbearers to carry me out,
and never hearin&#8217; a thing, and you sit there deaf and
dumb! Who was at that party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, poppa, there were just seven girls, counting
me: Mary Waterman, Minnie Briskett, Marian
Doane, and Libby Davis, and Mamie and her
guest&mdash;a cousin from Louisville. Of course, there
was nothing to drink but claret cup, with sprigs of
mint in the glasses.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;OH, I HAD ONE GLASS; NOBODY HAD MORE, I THINK; THERE WAS SOME<br />
KIND OF MINERAL WATER BESIDES. IT WAS ALL VERY SIMPLE&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;So the Pembrokes are comin&#8217; to it, are they?
They&#8217;ve got to have something that looks like
liquor&mdash;well, they&#8217;ll be passin&#8217; the cocktails before
long. Claret cup dressed up like juleps; and
how much did you get of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had one glass; nobody had more, I think;
there was some kind of mineral water besides. It
was all very simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a simple little luncheon, was it? Well, I
suppose it&#8217;s not too simple to get into the newspapers.
Nobody can put an extra plate on the
table now without the papers have to print it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had never quizzed her like this, and his reference
to the newspaper alarmed her. His usual custom
was to ask her what she had been doing and
whom she had seen and then change the subject in
the midst of her answer. If he had laid a trap for
her she had gone too far to retreat; and while she
had lied to him before, she had managed it more
discreetly. She had escaped detection so long that
she believed herself immune from discovery.</p>

<p>He began tugging at a newspaper that had been
hidden under his wrapper, and her heart throbbed
violently as he opened it and thrust it toward her.
It was the afternoon paper, folded back to the personal
and society items.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just read that aloud to me, will you? I may
have been mistaken. Maybe I didn&#8217;t get it straight.
Go ahead, now, and read it&mdash;read it slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew without looking what it was; the reading
was exacted merely to add to her discomfiture.
The newspaper was delivered punctually at four
o&#8217;clock every afternoon, so that before she left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Country Club he had known just where she had
been and the names of her companions. She read
in a low, monotonous tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mrs. Robert Smiley Kinney entertained at
luncheon at the Country Club to-day for Mrs.
Ridgeley P. Farwell, of Pittsburg, who is her house
guest. The decorations were in pink. Those who
enjoyed Mrs. Kinney&#8217;s hospitality were Mr. and
Mrs. Frederic Towlesley, Miss Nancy Farley, Miss
Edith Saxby, Mr. George K. Pickard, and Mr.
William B. Copeland.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She refolded the paper and placed it on the table
beside him. Instead of the violent lashing for which
she had steeled herself, he spoke her name very
kindly and gently, with even a lingering caress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I lied to you papa,&#8221; she faltered; &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t
mean to see him again. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be square about this,&#8221; he said, bending
forward and clasping his fingers over his knees.
&#8220;You promised me a year ago that you&#8217;d not
meet or see Copeland; I didn&#8217;t ask you to drop
Mrs. Kinney, for I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s a particularly
bad woman; she&#8217;s only a fool, and we&#8217;ve got to be
charitable in dealin&#8217; with fools. You can&#8217;t ever tell
when you&#8217;re not one yourself; that means me as
well as you, Nan. Now, about that worthless
whelp, Copeland! I want the whole truth&mdash;no
more little lies or big ones. You know that piece of
carrion wouldn&#8217;t dare come to this house, and yet
you sneak away and meet him and leave me to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
it out by accident! Now, I want the God&#8217;s truth;
just what does all this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>His quiet tone was weighted with the dignity, the
simple righteousness, that lay in him. She could
have met more courageously a violent tirade than
his subdued demand. She was conscious that he
had controlled himself with difficulty; throughout
the interview his wrath had flashed like heat-lightning
on far horizons, but he had kept himself
well in hand. He was outraged, but he was hurt,
troubled, perplexed by her conduct. The adoption
of Nan had marked a high altitude in the married
life of the Farleys, and they had lavished upon her
the pent love of their childlessness. The very manner
in which she had been flung upon their protection
made her advent in their household something
of an adventure, broadening their narrowing vistas
and bringing a welcome cheer to their monotonous
existence. They had felt it to be a duty, but one that
would repay them a thousand-fold in happiness.</p>

<p>Farley patiently awaited her explanation&mdash;an
explanation she dared not make. She must satisfy
him, if at all, by evasions and further lies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Kinney made a point of my coming; she
was always very nice to me, and I haven&#8217;t been
seeing her,&mdash;honestly I haven&#8217;t,&mdash;and I was
afraid she&#8217;d be offended if I refused to go. And I
didn&#8217;t know Mr. Copeland would be there. The
luncheon was in the big dining-room, where everybody
could see us. I didn&#8217;t see any more of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
than of anybody else. In fact, I got tired and ran
away&mdash;down to the river and was there by myself
for an hour before I came home on the trolley.
When I got back to the clubhouse, they had all
gone motoring and I didn&#8217;t see them again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Left you there, did they? Well, Copeland
waited for you, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she admitted quickly. &#8220;But I saw him
only a minute on the veranda and told him I was
coming home. He understands perfectly that you
don&#8217;t want me to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! I should hope he did! All that crowd
understand it, don&#8217;t they? They&#8217;ve been puttin&#8217;
you in his way, haven&#8217;t they,&mdash;tryin&#8217; to fix up
something between you and that loafer! Look here,
Nan, I&#8217;m not dead yet! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to live a long
time, and if these fool doctors have been tellin&#8217; you
I&#8217;m done for, they&#8217;ve lied. And if Copeland thinks
my money&#8217;s goin&#8217; to drop into his lap, he&#8217;s waitin&#8217;
under the wrong tree. Never a cent! What you
got to say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he ever thought of it; it&#8217;s only
because you don&#8217;t like him that you imagine he
wants to marry me. I tell you now that I have
never had any idea of marrying him. And as for
your money&mdash;it isn&#8217;t my fault that you brought
me here! You don&#8217;t have to give me a cent; I don&#8217;t
want it; I won&#8217;t take it! I was only a poor, ignorant
little nobody, anyhow, and you&#8217;ve been disappointed
in me from the start. I&#8217;ve never pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
you, no matter how hard I&#8217;ve tried. But I&#8217;ve done
the best I could, and I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve hurt you.
I never told you an untruth before,&#8221; she ran on
glibly; &#8220;and I wouldn&#8217;t to-day if I hadn&#8217;t guessed
that you knew where I&#8217;d been and were trying to
trick me into lying. You don&#8217;t love me any more,
papa; I know that; and I&#8217;m going away&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her histrionic talents, employed so successfully
in imitating him in his fury, for the pleasure of Mrs.
Kinney&#8217;s guests, were diverted now to self-martyrization
to the accompaniment of tears. She had been
closer to him than to his wife: what Mrs. Farley
denied in the way of indulgences he had usually
yielded. He had liked her liveliness, her keen wit,
the amusing cajoleries with which she played upon
him. The remote Irish in his blood had been responsive
to the fresher strain in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, stop bawlin&#8217;!&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;So you admit you lied, do you? Thought I had
laid a trap for you, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was difficult for him to realize that she was
twenty-two and quite old enough to be held accountable
for her sins. Her appeal to tears had
always found him weak, but her declaration that
she had suspected a trap when he began to quiz her
was a trifle too daring to pass unchallenged. He
repeated his demand that she sit up and stop
crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well go through with this, Nan. I
want to know what kind of an arrangement you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
have with Copeland. Are you in love with that
fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you promised to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you goin&#8217; places where you expect
to see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explained that, papa,&#8221; she replied with
more assurance, finding that he did not debate her
answers. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like to refuse Mrs. Kinney
when I&#8217;d been refusing so many of her invitations.
She asked me a while ago to come to her house to
spend a week; and a little before that she wanted
me to go on a trip with them, but you were sick and
I knew you didn&#8217;t like her, anyhow, so I refused.
You&#8217;ve got the wrong idea about her, papa,&#8221; she
continued ingratiatingly. &#8220;She&#8217;s really very nice.
The fact that she hasn&#8217;t been here long is against
her with some of the older women, but that&#8217;s just
snobbishness. I always thought you hated the
snobbishness of some of these people who have lived
here always and are snippy to anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was conscious that she was eluding him, and
he gripped his hands with a sudden resolution not
to be thwarted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a damn about the Kinneys; I&#8217;m
talkin&#8217; about you and Copeland,&#8221; he rasped impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, papa; I&#8217;ve told you all there is to
know about that&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you say &#8216;about that,&#8217;&#8221; he
mocked; &#8220;that worthless scoundrel seems to have
an evil fascination for you. I don&#8217;t understand it; a
decent young girl like you and a whiskey-soaked,
loafin&#8217;, gamblin&#8217; degenerate, who shook his wife&mdash;a
fine woman&mdash;to be free to trail after you! That
slimy wharf-rat has the fool idea that I took advantage
of him when I sold him my interest in
the store&mdash;and just to show you what a fool he
is I&#8217;ll tell you that I sold him my interest at a
tenth less than I could have got from three other
people&mdash;did it, so help me God, out of sheer
good feelin&#8217;, because he&#8217;s the son of a father
who&#8217;d given me a hand up, and I thought because
he was a fool I wouldn&#8217;t be just fair with him&mdash;I&#8217;d
be generous! I did that for Sam Copeland&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was four years ago, and I hadn&#8217;t much
idea then that he&#8217;d make good. He&#8217;s already
cashed in everything Sam left him but the store.
And I&#8217;ve still got his notes for twenty-five thousand
dollars&mdash;twenty-five thousand, mind you!&mdash;that
he&#8217;d like damned well to cancel by marryin&#8217; you.
A man nearly forty years old, who gambles and
soaks himself in cocktails and runs after a feather-head
like you while the business his father and I
made the best in the State goes plumb to hell!
Now, you listen to what I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;: if you want to
marry him, you do it,&mdash;you go ahead and do it
now, for if you wait for me to die, you&#8217;ll find he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
won&#8217;t be so anxious; there ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be anything
to marry you <i>for</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice that had been firm and strong at the
beginning of this long speech sank to a hoarse
whisper, but he cleared his throat and uttered his
last words with sharp distinctness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never meant to; I never had any idea of
marrying him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve never thought
of the money. You can do what you like with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a man can&#8217;t take his money with him to
the graveyard, but he can tie a pretty long string
to it; and it&#8217;s my duty to protect you as long as I
can. I&#8217;d hoped you&#8217;d be married and settled before
I went. Your mamma and I used to talk of that;
you&#8217;d got a pretty tight grip on us; it couldn&#8217;t
have been stronger if you&#8217;d been our own; and I
don&#8217;t want anything to spoil this, Nan. I want you
to be a good woman&mdash;not one of these high-flyin&#8217;,
drinkin&#8217; kind, that heads for the divorce court, but
decent and steady. Now, I guess that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood beside him for a moment, smoothing
his hair. Then she knelt, as though from an accession
of feeling, and took his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, papa! I never mean to hurt you;
but I know I do; I know I must have troubled
mamma, too, a very great deal. And you&#8217;ve both
been so good to me! And I want to show you I appreciate
it. And please don&#8217;t talk of the money
any more or of my marrying anybody. I don&#8217;t
want the money; I&#8217;m not going to marry: I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
us to live on just as we have been. You&#8217;ve been
cooped up too long, but you&#8217;re so much better now
you&#8217;ll soon be able to travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s no more travel for me; I&#8217;ll be glad
to hang on as I am. There&#8217;s nothing in this change
idea. About a year more&#8217;s all I count on, and then
you can throw me on the scrap-heap.&#8221;</p>

<p>She protested that there were many more comfortable
years ahead of him; the doctors had said so. At
the mention of doctors his anger flared again, but
for an instant only. It was a question whether he
had been mollified by her assurances or whether the
peace that now reigned was attributable to his satisfaction
with the plans he had devised to protect
her from fortune-hunters.</p>

<p>She hated scenes and trouble of any kind, and
peace or even a truce was worth having at any
price. She had grown so accustomed to the bright,
smooth surfaces of life as to be impatient of the
rough, unburnished edges. It was not wholly Nan&#8217;s
fault that she had reached womanhood selfish and
willful. In their ignorance and anxiety to do as
well by her as their neighbors did by their daughters,
there had been no bounds to the Farleys&#8217; indulgence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have dinner up here with you,&#8221;
she said cheerfully, after an interval. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of
eating alone downstairs with Miss Rankin; her
white cap gets on my nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>She satisfied herself that this plan pleased him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and ran downstairs whistling&mdash;then was up again
in her room, where he heard her quick step, the
opening and closing of drawers.</p>

<p>She faced him across the small table in the plainest
of white frocks, with her hair arranged in a
simple fashion he had once commended. She told
stories&mdash;anecdotes she had gathered while dressing,
from the back pages of &#8220;Life.&#8221; He was himself
a capital story-teller, though at the age when a
man repeats, and she listened to tales of his steamboating
days that she had heard for years and
could have told better herself.</p>

<p>Soon a thunder-shower cooled the air, and made
necessary the closing of windows, with a resulting
domestic intimacy. The atmosphere was redolent
of forgiveness on his part, of a wish to please on hers.</p>

<p>At nine o&#8217;clock, when she had finished reading
some chapters from &#8220;Life on the Mississippi,&#8221;&mdash;a
book that he kept in his room,&mdash;and Miss Rankin
appeared to put him to bed, he begged half an
hour more. He hadn&#8217;t felt so well for a year, he
declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Nan,&#8221; he remarked, when the nurse
had retired after a grudging acquiescence, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want you to feel I&#8217;m hard on you. I guess I talk
pretty rough sometimes, but I don&#8217;t mean to. But
I worry about you&mdash;what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to happen to you
after I&#8217;m gone. I wish I&#8217;d gone first, so mamma
could have looked after you. You know we set a
lot by you. If I&#8217;m hard on you, I don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>She flung herself down beside him and clasped
his face in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear old fraud!&mdash;there can&#8217;t be any
trouble between you and me, and as for your leaving
me&mdash;why, that&#8217;s a long, long time ahead.
And you can&#8217;t tell! I might go first&mdash;I have all
kinds of queer symptoms&mdash;honestly, I do! And
the doctor made me stop dancing last winter because
my heart was going jigglety. Please let&#8217;s be
good friends and cheerful as we always have been,
and I&#8217;ll never, never tell you any fibs any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw that her nearness, the touch of her hands,
her supple young body pressed against his worn
knees, were freeing the remotest springs of affection
in his tired heart.</p>

<p>Nan wanted to be good&mdash;&#8220;good&#8221; in the sense
of the word that had expressed the simple piety of
her foster-mother. She had the conscience of her
temperament and from childhood had often been
miserable over the smallest infractions of discipline.
Her last words with Copeland on the club veranda
had not left her happy. It had been in her mind for
some time that she must break with Billy. She had
never been able to convince herself that she loved
him. She had liked his admiration, and had over-valued
it as coming from a man much older than
herself; one who, moreover, stood to her as a protagonist
of the gay world. No one but Billy Copeland
gave suppers for visiting actors and actresses or
chartered a fleet of canoes for a thousand-dollar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
picnic up the river. It was because he was different
and amusing and made love to her with an ardor
her nature craved that she had so readily lent herself
to the efforts of the Kinneys to throw them
together.</p>

<p>Being loved by Copeland, a divorced man rated
&#8220;fast,&#8221; had all the more piquancy for Nan as affording
a relief from the life of the staid, colorless household
in which she had been reared. There were
those who, without being snobs, looked down just
a little upon a girl who was merely an adopted child
to whom her foster-parents gave only a shadowy
background. The Farleys were substantial and respectable,
but they were not an &#8220;old family.&#8221; She
was conscious of this, and the knowledge had made
her the least bit rebellious and the more ready to
surrender to the blandishments of the Kinneys, who
were even more under the ban.</p>

<p>As she undressed and crept wearily into bed, she
pondered these things, and the thought of them
did not increase her happiness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>NAN AND BILLY&#8217;S WIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farley</span> improved as the summer gained headway.
He became astonishingly better, and his doctor
prescribed an automobile in the hope that a
daily airing would exercise a beneficent effect upon
his temper. Farley detested automobiles and had
told Nan frequently that they were used only by
fools and bankrupts. A neighbor who failed in
business that spring had been one of the first men
in town to fall a victim to the motor craze, and
Farley had noted with grim delight that three
automobiles were named among the bankrupt&#8217;s
assets.</p>

<p>When the idea of investing in a machine took
hold of him, he went into the subject with his
characteristic thoroughness. He had Nan buy all
the magazines and cut from them the automobile
advertisements and he sent for his friends to pump
them as to their knowledge of various cars. Then
he commissioned a mechanical engineer to buy him
a machine that could climb any hill in the State,
and that was free of the frailties and imperfections
of which his friends complained.</p>

<p>Farley manifested a childlike joy in his new
plaything; he declared that he would have a negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
chauffeur. It would be like old steamboat times, he
said, to go &#8220;sailin&#8217; around with a nigger to cuss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan or the nurse went out with him daily&mdash;preferably
Nan, who was immensely relieved to
find that they were now on better terms than for
several years. Life hadn&#8217;t been a gay promenade
since she ceased to share the festivities of the Kinneys
and their friends. Copeland she had dismissed
finally, and the rest of them wearied of calling her
on the telephone only to be told that it was impossible
for her to make engagements. It may have
been that Farley realized that she was trying to
meet his wishes; at any rate, she had no cause to
complain of his kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;This would have tickled mamma,&#8221; he would
say, as they rolled through the country in the machine.
&#8220;She was always afraid of horses; these
things don&#8217;t seem half as risky when you get used
to &#8217;em. If I keep on feelin&#8217; better, we&#8217;ll take some
long trips this fall. There&#8217;s a lot o&#8217; places I&#8217;d like
to see again. I&#8217;d like to go down and take another
look at the Ohio.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke much of his wife, and at least once
every week drove to the cemetery, and watched
Nan place flowers on her foster-mother&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p>After one of these visits he ordered the chauffeur
to drive north. He had read in the papers of the
sale of a farm at what he said was a record price for
land in that neighborhood, and he wanted to take a
look at the property. After they had inspected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
farm and were running toward home, Nan suggested
that they stop at the Country Club for a
cool drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s drive to Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s place,&#8221; he remarked
casually. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always meant to look at her
farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched her sharply, as though expecting her
to object. Possibly he had some purpose in this; or
the suggestion might be due to malevolence; but
she dismissed any such idea. He was always curious
about people, and there was, to be sure, no
reason why he should not call on Mrs. Copeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly; I shall be very glad to go, papa,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; he said, laying his hand on her wrist,
&#8220;there was never any trouble between you and that
woman about Copeland, was there? If it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
make you uncomfortable to stop at her house, why,
we won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, papa. I hope she understood
that I couldn&#8217;t help the gossip. It wasn&#8217;t my
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was nasty, anyhow,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;And as you&#8217;ve got rid of Copeland, it wouldn&#8217;t
be a bad idea to let her know it. I guess it won&#8217;t
be long before that worthless scamp goes to the
dump. I&#8217;ve got a pretty good line on him and the
store. If I was ten years younger, I&#8217;d go down
there and kick him out and put the house on its feet
again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>He had frequently told her that Copeland-Farley
was doing badly, but she supposed this to be only
the wail of a retired pilot who thinks his old ship
is doomed to disaster without his hand at the wheel.
No communications had passed between her and
Billy since the day of Grace Kinney&#8217;s party. She
persuaded herself that she could face Billy Copeland&#8217;s
former wife with a good conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hound,&#8221; began Farley after an interval of
silence, &#8220;had the brass to try to put her in the
wrong&mdash;didn&#8217;t dare go into court with it, but let
it be whispered on the outside to save his own face!
There was a man somewhere used to visit here, a
friend of his. I guess nobody took any stock in that
scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, nobody would believe it of her,&#8221;
said Nan. &#8220;I hardly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had begun to say that it was incredible that
Billy would have done such a thing, but she caught
herself in time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Farley sharply. &#8220;Well, I
guess nobody but the lowest cur would have
done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s brown bungalow was set upon
the highest point on her farm, and from her veranda
and windows she could view every part of it. The
veranda was made to be lived upon; there was a
table with books and periodicals; a work-basket
lay in a swing seat as though some one had just
put it down; there were wall-pockets filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
fresh flowers. Along the veranda rail nasturtiums
bloomed luxuriantly.</p>

<p>As Nan waited for an answer to her ring, the
lower floor of the house lay plainly in view through
the screen door: a large raftered living-room with a
broad fireplace and a dining-room beyond. Here at
least were comfort and peace. Perhaps Billy Copeland&#8217;s
wife hadn&#8217;t fared so ill after all!</p>

<p>The maid said Mrs. Copeland was out on the
farm, and an observation from the veranda discovered
her in the barn lot.</p>

<p>Nan had counted on Farley&#8217;s presence to ease
the shock of the meeting, and she did not wholly
relish being sent off alone to meet a woman who
might be pardoned for wishing to avoid her. Farley
said he would wait in the car, and Nan left him contentedly
studying the house and its encompassing
landscape.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Copeland saw Nan approaching, she
started across the lot to meet her. A handsome
collie trotted beside her. She had not yet identified
her visitor, and was flinging back an injunction to
a workman as she moved toward the gate. She
wore a dark skirt, blue waist, and heavy shoes, and
a boy&#8217;s round felt hat. A pair of shabby tan driving-gloves
covered her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon!&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;Papa and I were
passing, and he thought he&#8217;d like to see your place.
If you&#8217;re busy, please don&#8217;t bother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad so see you, Miss Farley; I was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
coming to the house. My pump works badly and
we are planning some changes. I&#8217;m glad Mr.
Farley is able to be out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She set the pace with a quick, eager step. Several
times she turned smilingly toward Nan; the girl
saw no trace of hostility. To all appearances Fanny
Copeland was a happy, contented woman. The tempests
might vent their spite on her, but she would still
hold her head high. Nan, little given to humility,
experienced suddenly a disturbing sense of her inferiority
to this woman whose husband she had allowed
to make love to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I get a great deal of fun out of the farm,&#8221;
Mrs. Copeland was saying. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any
time to be lonesome; when there&#8217;s nothing else to
do, I can fuss around the garden. And now that I&#8217;ve
taken up poultry there&#8217;s more to do than ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;d get on better with chickens than
with cows,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t scare me
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, cows are adorable! Aren&#8217;t these in this
pasture beauties!&#8221;</p>

<p>A calf thrust its head through the bars of the
fence, and Fanny patted its nose. Nan asked if
they all had names and Mrs. Copeland declared
that naming the calves was the hardest part of her
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a mistake for a girl to grow up
without knowing how to earn her own living, and I
don&#8217;t know a thing!&#8221; said Nan impulsively.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">NAN EXPERIENCED SUDDENLY A DISTURBING SENSE<br />
OF HER INFERIORITY TO THIS WOMAN</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Fanny looked at her quickly. If it was in her
mind that the obvious and expected thing for Nan
to do was to marry Billy Copeland, she made no
sign. Nan was amazed to find that she was anxious
to appear to advantage before this woman who had
every reason for disliking and distrusting her, and
she was conscious that she had never seemed so
stupid. Her modish gown, her dainty slippers with
their silver buckles, contrasted oddly with Fanny&#8217;s
simple workaday apparel. She was self-conscious,
uncomfortable. And yet Fanny was wholly at
ease, talking light-heartedly as though no shadow
had ever darkened her life.</p>

<p>They reached the house and found that Farley
had braved the steps and established himself on the
veranda. The maid had brought him a glass of
milk which he was sipping contentedly while he
ran his eye over a farm paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Copeland, what will you take for your
place?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;If I&#8217;d moved into the
country when I quit business, the doctors wouldn&#8217;t
be doggin&#8217; me to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Miss Farley tells me you are almost well
again! It&#8217;s fine that you&#8217;ve taken up motoring&mdash;a
new world to conquer every morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got tired o&#8217; bein&#8217; hitched to the bedpost; that&#8217;s
all. But I want to talk farm. It&#8217;s a great thing for
a woman to run a place like this and I want you
to tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He examined and cross-examined her as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
joys and sorrows of dairying. She replied good-naturedly
to most of his questions and parried the
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m not going to tell you how much I
lose a year! Please keep it a dark secret, but I&#8217;m
not losing anything; and besides, I&#8217;m having a
mighty good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he warned her, &#8220;don&#8217;t let it put you
in a hole. The place may be a leetle too fancy.
You don&#8217;t want to make your butter too good;
your customers won&#8217;t appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You preach what you never practiced,&#8221; laughed
Nan. &#8220;Your rule at the store was to give full
measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I held trade when I got it,&#8221; he
admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been adding another department to the
farm,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland. &#8220;I started it early in
the summer in the old farmhouse back there that
was on the place when father bought it. Real
homemade canned fruit, pickles, and so on. I&#8217;ve
set up four girls who&#8217;d found life a hard business,
and they&#8217;re doing the work with a farmer&#8217;s wife to
boss them. It&#8217;s my business to sell their products.
I&#8217;ve interested some of the farmers&#8217; daughters, and
they come over and help the regulars on busy days.
We&#8217;re having a lot of fun out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley was immensely interested. Nan had not
in a long time heard him talk so much or so amiably;
he praised and continued to praise Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
enterprise and success; for he had satisfied
himself fully that she was successful. He clearly
liked her; her quiet humor, her grace and prettiness.
In his blunt way he told her she was getting handsomer
all the time. She knew how to talk to men of
his type and met him on his own ground.</p>

<p>He began telling stories and referred to Old Sam
Copeland half a dozen times, quite unconscious
that the sometime daughter-in-law of Old Sam was
sitting before him. Nan grew nervous, but Mrs.
Copeland met the situation with perfect composure.</p>

<p>Finally, when they were about to leave, Eaton
appeared. He had walked over from the Country
Club merely, he protested, to refresh himself at
Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s buttermilk fountains. He addressed
himself cordially to Farley, whose liking
for him was manifest in a brightening of the old
man&#8217;s eyes. It was plain that Eaton and Mrs.
Copeland were on the friendliest terms; they called
each other by their first names without mincing or
sidling.</p>

<p>Nan suspected that Eaton had come by arrangement
and that in all likelihood he meant to stay for
dinner; but already the lawyer was saying, as he
saw Farley taking out his watch:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to beg a lift into town from you
plutocrats. I thought I could stay me with flagons
of buttermilk and catch the interurban that gallops
by at five fifty; but I made a miscalculation and
have already missed the car.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;I can send you in,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland, &#8220;if it
isn&#8217;t perfectly convenient for Mr. Farley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course Eaton will go with us,&#8221; said Farley
cordially. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to move, Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Eaton helped him down the steps, Mrs.
Copeland detained Nan for glimpses of the landscape
from various points on the veranda.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nice of you to stop; I think we ought to
know each other better,&#8221; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Nan, surprised and pleased.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be my fault if we don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they crossed the veranda their hands touched
idly, and Mrs. Copeland caught Nan&#8217;s fingers and
held them till they reached the steps. This trifling
girlish act exercised a curious, bewildering effect
upon Nan. She might have argued from it that
Mrs. Copeland didn&#8217;t <i>know</i>&mdash;didn&#8217;t know that
she was touching the hand of the woman who was
accused of stealing her husband&#8217;s affections.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see many people,&#8221; Mrs. Copeland was
saying; &#8220;and sometimes I get lonesome. You must
bring your father out again, very soon. He can ride
to the barn in his machine and see my whole plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would like that; he&#8217;s one of your warmest
admirers, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We always did seem to understand each other,&#8221;
she laughed; &#8220;probably because I always talk back
to him.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;I&#8217;M NOT LOSING ANYTHING; AND BESIDES, I&#8217;M<br />
HAVING A MIGHTY GOOD TIME&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s much gentler than he looks or talks; and
he means to be kind and just,&#8221; replied Nan, knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
in her heart that she had frequently questioned
both his kindness and his justice. &#8220;I hope you will
stop and see us, very soon. Papa&#8217;s getting too
much of my company; it would cheer him a lot to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never make calls, you know,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland,
smiling, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to accept your invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bitterness and resentment, traces of which Nan
had sought in this cheery, alert little woman, were
not apparent. Her kindness and sweetness and
tolerance, as of the fields themselves, impressed
Nan deeply.</p>

<p>In saying good-bye Nan impulsively put out both
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could be good friends!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her face flushed scarlet the moment she had
spoken, but Fanny&#8217;s manner betrayed no agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s consider that we&#8217;re already old friends,&#8221;
she responded, smiling into the girl&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>A COLLECTOR OF FACTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jerry came in &#8220;off the road&#8221; Saturday, he
found a note from Eaton asking him to call at his
office that evening. To comply with this request,
Jerry was obliged to forego the delights of a dance
at the Little Ripple Club to which he had looked
forward with the liveliest anticipations all the week.
But Eaton was not, in Amidon&#8217;s estimation, a person
to whom one telephoned regrets with impunity,
and at eight o&#8217;clock he knocked at Eaton&#8217;s door on
the fifteenth floor of the White River Trust Building
and was admitted by the lawyer in person.</p>

<p>Eaton&#8217;s office always exerted a curious spell on
Jerry&#8217;s imagination. This was attributable in some
measure to the presence of cabinets filled with models
of patentable and unpatentable devices&mdash;queer
contrivances with each its story of some inventor&#8217;s
success or failure. The most perfect order was
everywhere apparent. Books from the ample library
were never strewn about in the manner of most
law offices, and Eaton&#8217;s flat-top desk in the last
room of the suite was usually clear; or if papers
were permitted to lie upon it, they were piled evenly
and weighted with a smooth stone that was never
visible unless in use. The file-cases (of the newest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and most approved type) contained not only
letters, legal papers, and receipts, but, known to
no one but the girl who cared for them, newspaper
clippings and typewritten memoranda on a thousand
and one subjects that bore no apparent relation
to the practice of law.</p>

<p>Facts were Eaton&#8217;s passion; with facts, one
might, he believed, conquer the world; indeed, he
was capable of demonstrating that all the battles
in history were lost or won by the facts carried into
the contest by the respective commanders. He had
so often disturbed the office of the Commissioner of
Patents with his facts that the public servants in
charge of that department were little disposed to
risk a brush with him on points that involved facts,
facts that seemed, in his use of them, to glitter like
the lenses of his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>He seated himself in his office chair&mdash;a leathern
affair with a high back&mdash;and bade Amidon shed his
coat and be comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke?&#8221; he suggested, opening a drawer containing
cigars and cigarettes. Jerry hated ready-made
cigarettes, but he was afraid to produce the
&#8220;makings&#8221; before Eaton, who had once complained
that the odor of the tobacco he affected was suggestive
of burning jimson weed. Eaton produced a
glass ash-tray, and filled a pipe with the deliberation
he brought to every act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Business is bad, I suppose, as usual,&#8221; he remarked
leadingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;Rotten! The shark that runs the credits has
cut off one or two of my easiest marks; but I
managed to end last month with a ten-per-cent
advance over last year&#8217;s business, and that helps
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have spoken well, Amidon. I suppose you
were received with joyous acclaim by the boss, and
urged to accept a raise in wages?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop kidding me! I&#8217;m sensitive about my
wages. They still pretend they&#8217;re just trying me
out&mdash;not sure I&#8217;ll make good and that sort of
piffle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sort of piffle&#8221; was a phrase he had taken
over bodily from Eaton&#8217;s familiar discourse. So
sensitive was he to Eaton&#8217;s influence that he imitated,
with fair success, the unruffled ease that was
second nature to the lawyer. He was also practicing
Eaton&#8217;s trick of blinking before uttering a sentence,
and then letting it slip with a casual, indifferent
air. Eaton had used this in the cross-examination
of witnesses to good purpose. Amidon had
exercised it so constantly in commercial and social
conversation that he had to be on guard lest Eaton,
whose discernment seemed to him to partake of the
supernatural, should catch him at it and detect its
spuriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won a case somewhat in your line the other
day; defended a trade-mark of the Pomona Velvet
Complexion Cream, warranted to remove whole
constellations of freckles in one night. Seductive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
label, showing a lovely maiden unfreckling herself
before a mirror; bottle of Pomona in her hand.
Basely and clumsily imitated by a concern in
Kansas that&#8217;s been feloniously uttering a Romona
Complexion Cream. The only original Pomona
girl held the bottle in her right hand; label on Romona
nostrum showed it clenched in her left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard luck!&#8221; said Amidon, deeply interested.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pushing that Kansas beautifier&mdash;a
larger discount for the jobber than the Pomona.
Reckon we&#8217;ll have to chuck it now. I suppose the
judge didn&#8217;t know Pomona removes the cuticle&mdash;hasn&#8217;t
the real soothing effect of the Romona.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll mention that to the district attorney and he
can pass it on to the government inspectors. I&#8217;m
annoyed by your revelation. Shock to my conscience&mdash;defending
a company that poisons the
young and beautiful of the republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you know what a swindle you defended,
I suppose you&#8217;ll turn back your fee&mdash;if
you&#8217;ve got it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Retainer of a thousand dollars,&#8221; Eaton replied
easily; &#8220;it would be immoral to return it, thus increasing
the dividends of such an unscrupulous corporation.
However, I&#8217;ll consider giving half of it
to the Children&#8217;s Aid Society.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pleasant in any circumstances to sit in
Eaton&#8217;s presence, to enjoy his confidence; and yet
nothing so far disclosed justified Jerry&#8217;s relinquishment
of the Little Ripple Club dance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Which of our noble streams did you follow this
trip&mdash;the Pan-haunted Wabash or the mighty
Ohio, sacred to the muses nine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Allusions of this sort, to which Eaton was prone,
were Jerry&#8217;s despair. He felt that it would be worth
subjecting one&#8217;s self to the discomforts of a college
education to be able to talk like this, easily and
naturally. But he was aware that Eaton was driving
at something; and while it was the lawyer&#8217;s way
to lead conversations into blind alleys, he always
arrived somewhere and fitted a key into the lock
that had been his aim from the start.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shook hands with the trade along the Ohio
this trip. I can tell you it&#8217;s lonesome at night in
those river burgs; the folks just sit and wait for the
spring flood&mdash;and even <i>it</i> fails sometimes. They
turn the reel once daily in the movies, and the whole
town&#8217;s asleep at nine-thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A virtuous and home-loving people, but crime
occasionally disturbs the peace. Murders should
always occur along navigable streams, so the victim
can be sent cruising at once toward New Orleans
and the still-vexed Bermoothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidon thought he caught a gleam; but experience
had taught him the unwisdom of anticipating
the unfolding of Eaton&#8217;s purposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s always a lot of crooks loafing along
the river; they keep their skins filled with whiskey
and they fish and shoot muskrats and do a little
murdering on the side.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Interesting type,&#8221; said Eaton musingly. &#8220;If
you were at Belleville this week, you must have
heard of a murder down there&mdash;man found stabbed
to death in a house-boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry grinned, pleased with his own perspicacity in
having surmised the object of the interview. Murder
was not, Amidon would have said, within the range
of Mr. John Cecil Eaton&#8217;s interests; and yet this
was not the first time that the lawyer&#8217;s inquiries
had touched affairs that seemed wholly foreign to
his proper orbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there the day after they found the body.
They had already arrested the wrong man and
turned him loose&mdash;as usual. They always do that;
and they&#8217;ll probably pick up some tramp who was
visiting old college friends in New York when the
murder was committed and indict him so the prosecuting
attorney can show he&#8217;s on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t speak in that manner of sworn
officers of the law,&#8221; Eaton admonished. &#8220;Better
that forty innocent men should be hanged than that
one guilty man escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry fidgeted nervously as Eaton&#8217;s glasses were
turned for a full minute upon the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Cincinnati paper printed an item yesterday
about that murder case, mentioning the arrest of
a suspect at Henderson on the Kentucky shore.&#8221;
Eaton hesitated. &#8220;The suspect&#8217;s name was Corrigan.
You have known Corrigans, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a faint tinkle in the remote recesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
of Jerry&#8217;s consciousness as the shot, so carelessly
fired, reached the target.</p>

<p>&#8220;The name&#8217;s common enough; I&#8217;ve known a
number of Corrigans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the lawyer continued, &#8220;there have been
instances of Corrigans ceasing to be Corrigans and
becoming something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; Amidon replied, meeting Eaton&#8217;s
eyes as they were bent suddenly upon him, &#8220;that
a Corrigan might become a Farley. Am I right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right. I was just wondering whether you
had picked up anything about this particular case
down along the river. I have no interest in it whatever&mdash;only
the idlest curiosity. I happened to recall
that Miss Farley had been a Corrigan; I have a
note of that somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung his chair round and surveyed the file-cases
back of him. His gaze fell upon a drawer
marked <i>F</i>, as though he were reading the contents
through the label&mdash;a feat which Amidon thought
not beyond Eaton&#8217;s powers.</p>

<p>Jerry resented the idea that Nan Farley might
still be affected by the lawless deeds of any of her
kinsfolk; he became increasingly uncomfortable the
more he reflected that the lawyer, with all his indifference,
would not be discussing this subject unless
he had some reason for doing so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was stated that this particular Corrigan had
wealthy connections&mdash;that always sounds well in
such news items, as though rich relations were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
mitigating circumstance likely to arouse public sympathy.
Mere snobbishness, Amidon; and snobbishness
is always detestable. If that particular
Corrigan hopes to obtain help from a sister now
known as Farley, it occurred to me that I ought to
possess myself of the fact. You understand that
what we&#8217;re saying to each other is entirely <i>sub rosa</i>.
We&#8217;ve never happened to speak of Miss Farley; but
having been connected with the Copeland-Farley
Company before Farley retired, you probably have
heard of her. A very interesting girl&mdash;slightly
spoiled by prosperity, but really refreshingly original.
Do you mind telling me whether you have any
reason for believing that the particular Corrigan
arrested down there as a suspect, and with those
wealthy connections so discreetly suggested in the
newspaper, is related in any way to Nan Farley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there was a Corrigan boy, considerably
older than I am&mdash;probably about thirty now, and
not much to brag of. I&#8217;ve asked about him now
and then when I dropped off at Belleville, and I
never heard any good of him&mdash;just about the kind
of scamp that would mix up in a cutting scrape and
get pinched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who, having been pinched,&mdash;what we
may call a pinchee, one who has been pinched,&mdash;might
perhaps remember that he had a prosperous
sister somewhere and appeal to her for help? Such
things have happened; it would be very annoying
for a young woman who had emerged&mdash;risen&mdash;climbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
away from her state of Corriganism, so to
speak, to have her relationship with such a person
printed in the newspapers of her own city. I merely
wish to be prepared for any emergency that may
arise. Not, of course, that this is any of my business;
but it&#8217;s remarkable how other people&#8217;s
affairs become in a way our own. Somebody has
remarked that life is altogether a matter of our
reciprocal obligations. There&#8217;s much truth in that,
Amidon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry did not wholly grasp this, but he confirmed
it with a nod. Now that Nan Farley had been mentioned,
he hoped Eaton would drop life&#8217;s reciprocal
obligations and talk of her; and he began describing
his meeting with her, in such manner as to present
his quondam schoolmate in the most favorable light.</p>

<p>Eaton listened to this recital with as much interest
as he ever exhibited in anything that was said
to him. He smiled at the young fellow&#8217;s frank acknowledgment
that it was in a spirit of the most
servile imitation that he had gone forth with his fly-box.
The ways in which Amidon aped him amused
Eaton. He addressed him as &#8220;Amidon,&#8221; or as &#8220;my
dear Amidon,&#8221; or &#8220;my dear fellow,&#8221; and talked to
him exactly as he talked to his cronies at the University
Club; for while he was looked upon as an
aristocrat,&mdash;the last of an old family that dated
back to the beginnings of the town,&mdash;at heart he
was the soundest of democrats. Jerry&#8217;s meeting
with Nan on the river bank seemed to him the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
delightful of confrontations, and he sought by characteristic
means to extract every detail of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, after she had been so nice and turned
to go, she swung round and came back&mdash;actually
came back to shake hands! I call that pretty fine;
and me just a little scrub that was only a bunch of
freckles and as tough a little mutt as ever lived
when she used to know me. Why, if she&#8217;d said she
never heard of me, she&#8217;d have put it over and I
couldn&#8217;t have said a word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She mentioned the meeting to me a little later,&#8221;
observed Eaton carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like thunder she did!&#8221; exploded Jerry. &#8220;So
you knew all about it and let me go ahead just to
kid me! Well, I like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely to get as much light on the subject as
possible. We stumble too much in darkness; the
truth helps a good deal, Amidon. Miss Farley
spoke of you in terms that would not have displeased
you. I assure you that she had enjoyed
the interview; her description of it was flattering
to your tact, your intuitive sense of social values.
But it was all very sketchy&mdash;you&#8217;ve filled in important
omissions. For instance, the giving of her
hand, as an afterthought, was not mentioned; but
I visualize it perfectly from your narrative. We
may read into that act good-fellowship, graciousness,
and all that sort of thing. She&#8217;s a graceful
person, and I can quite see her extending a perfectly
gloved hand&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Wrong for once; she hadn&#8217;t on any gloves! But
she had a handkerchief. It was drying on a bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That is very important. Tears, perhaps?
Her presence alone on the shore rather calls for an
explanation. If she had gone down there by herself
to cry, it is imaginable that life hadn&#8217;t been
wholly to her taste earlier in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t look as though she had ever cried a
tear in her life, and why should she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Irish,&#8221; replied Eaton reflectively, &#8220;are a
temperamental race. I had knowledge of her&mdash;remote
but sufficient&mdash;before she sought the cool,
umbrageous shore. Her companions were the gayest,
and they doubtless bored her until a mood of
introspection seized her&mdash;sorrow, regret, a resolve
to do quite differently. Very likely you were a
humble instrument of Providence to win her back
to a good opinion of herself. So she seemed quite
jolly and radiant? Conceivably your appearance
caused her to think of her blessings&mdash;of her far
flight from those scenes your presence summoned
from the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s a fine girl all right,&#8221; Amidon commented
to cover his embarrassment at being unable
to follow Eaton in his excursion into the realm of
psychology. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have thought that
girl, born in a shack with as good-for-nothing folks
as anybody ever had, would grow up to be about
the finest living girl! I guess you&#8217;d hunt pretty
hard before you&#8217;d find a girl to touch her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that myself, though not in quite
your felicitous phrases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub it in!&#8221; Amidon protested. &#8220;I guess
the less I think about a girl like that the better for
me. And I guess there&#8217;s plenty of fellows got their
eye on her. I&#8217;ve heard some talk at the store about
her and the boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t lack admirers, of course. When
you say &#8216;boss,&#8217; you refer, I assume, to Mr. Copeland?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton looked up from the polishing of his
glasses&mdash;a rite performed with scrupulous care.
The vague stare of his near-sighted eyes, unprotected
by his glasses, added to a disinterestedness
expressed otherwise by his careless tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Amidon began, defensively, &#8220;Copeland
is the boss, all right,&mdash;that is, when he&#8217;s on the
job at all. He&#8217;s some sport, but when he calls me
into his pen and goes over my orders, he knows
whether I&#8217;m on the right side of the average. Only
he doesn&#8217;t do that with any of the boys more than
once in two months. He doesn&#8217;t quite get the
habit; just seems to think of it occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capacity without application! Unfortunate,
but not incurable. To be sure, an old business like
Copeland-Farley is hard to kill. Billy Copeland&#8217;s
father had the constructive genius, and Farley had
the driving power. It&#8217;s up to Billy not to let the
house die on his hands. Trouble is, the iron diminishes
in the blood of a new generation: too easy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
time of it, soft-handed, loss of moral force, and that
sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Copeland travels a pretty lively clip, all
right,&#8221; ventured Amidon, not without a tinge of
pride in his boss. &#8220;He and Kinney are pace-setters;
they&#8217;ve got plenty of gasoline in the buggy and like
to burn it. The boss may be a sport, but he&#8217;s a
good fellow, anyhow. I guess if he wants to marry
Miss Farley he&#8217;s got a right to.&#8221;</p>

<p>He uttered this tamely, doubtful as to how his
guide and mentor might receive it, but anxious to
evoke an expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;A trifle weak, but well-meaning,&#8221; remarked
Eaton, as though he had been searching some time
for a phrase that expressed his true appraisement
of Copeland. &#8220;It&#8217;s deplorable that fellows like that&mdash;who
really have some capacity, but who are
weak-sinewed morally&mdash;can&#8217;t be protected from
their own folly; saved, perhaps. Our religion, Amidon,
is deficient in its practical application. A hand
on your boss&#8217;s shoulder at the right moment, a
word of friendly admonition, might&mdash;er&mdash;save
him from a too-wasteful expenditure of gasoline. If
I had the gift of literary expression, I should like to
write a treatise on man&#8217;s duty to man. It&#8217;s odd,
Amidon,&#8221; he went on, refilling his pipe, &#8220;that we
must sit by&mdash;chaps like you and me&mdash;and see
our brothers skidding into the ditch and never feel
any responsibility about them. Doubtless you and
I are known to many of our friends as weak mortals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in dire need of help,&mdash;or, perhaps, only a word of
warning that the bridges are down ahead of us
would suffice,&mdash;and yet how rarely do we feel
that hand on the shoulder? We should be annoyed,
displeased, hot clean through, if anybody&mdash;even
an old and valued friend&mdash;should beg us to slow
down. It&#8217;s queer, Amidon, how reluctant we are to
extend the saving hand. Timidity, fear of offending
and that sort of thing holds us back. It becomes
necessary to perform our Christian duty in the dark,
by the most indirect and hidden methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidon frowned, not sure that he understood;
and he hated himself when he did not understand
Eaton. Not to grasp his friend&#8217;s ideas convicted
him of stupidity and ignorance. Religion in Amidon&#8217;s
experience meant going to church and being
bored. He remembered that the last time he had
visited a church he had gone to hear a girl acquaintance
sing a solo. She sang very badly, indeed, and
he had been depressed by the knowledge that she
was spending for music lessons wages earned as a
clerk at the soap and perfumery counter in a department
store. Eaton&#8217;s occasional monologues on what,
for a better name, he called his friend&#8217;s religion,
struck him as fantastic; he was never sure that
Eaton wasn&#8217;t kidding him; and the suspicion that
you are being kidded by a man at whose feet you
sit in adoration is not agreeable. But Eaton had become
intelligible again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sometimes wondered whether Copeland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
shouldn&#8217;t be saved&mdash;a good subject for experiment,
at least. To demonstrate that we have the
courage of our convictions we must take a hard nut
to crack. Queer thing, that religious effort, as we
now see it, is directed solely to the poor and needy&mdash;the
down-and-outers. Take a man of the day
laborer type, the sort that casually beats his wife
for recreation: gets clear down in the gutter, and
the Salvation Army tackles his case&mdash;sets him up
again; good work! Great institution&mdash;the Army.
But you take the men who belong to clubs and eat
course dinners; they don&#8217;t beat their wives&mdash;only
say unpleasant things to them when the bills run
too high; when such fellows get restless, absorb too
much drink, neglect business, begin seeing their
bankers in the back room&mdash;where&#8217;s your man,
society, agency, to put the necessary hand on that
particular shoulder? What we do, Amidon, when
we see such a chap turning up Monday morning
with a hang-over from Saturday night, is to remark,
&#8216;Too bad about Tom&#8217;&mdash;or &#8216;Dick&#8217; or &#8216;Harry&#8217;&mdash;and
then go to the club and order a cocktail. That&#8217;s
how we meet our reciprocal obligations!&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed nothing that Amidon could add to
this; but plainly it was &#8220;Billy&#8221; Copeland, who was
in Eaton&#8217;s mind, and no imaginary Tom, Dick, or
Harry; so he ventured to remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess the boss hasn&#8217;t let go yet; he&#8217;ll
pull up. He&#8217;s the best man on the street to work
for&mdash;when you can feel you <i>are</i> working for him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Pleasanter to work for a boss than the boss&#8217;s
creditors, of course. And minor stockholders
sometimes get anxious and cause trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>These utterances were like important memoranda
jotted down on the margin of a page whose text is
of little value in itself. Amidon stared blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that; I guess the
house has always made money. We do more business
than any other drug house in the State.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent business, of course. And we&#8217;d
imagine that a man falling heir to it would take
pride in holding on to it. But if he doesn&#8217;t, somebody
else will take the job. I&#8217;ve seen the signs
change on a good many business houses in my day.
Your boss has taken several little flyers on the outside
since his father died; he&#8217;s rather fascinated
with the idea of being vice-president of new concerns:
minor trust companies, doubtful manufacturing
schemes, and that sort of thing. All this is
entirely in confidence; I&#8217;m using you as an incentive
to thought. Kindly consider that my reflections
are all <i>inter nos</i>. That murder business got
us started&mdash;but of course, it hasn&#8217;t anything to
do with your boss. It had occurred to me, though,
that both you and I may have certain reciprocal
obligations in some of these matters we have
touched on. One never can tell where the opportunity
to serve&mdash;to lay that friendly hand on a
particular shoulder&mdash;may present itself!&#8221;</p>

<p>During a rather long silence Amidon pondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
this, wholly mystified as to just what he or John
Cecil Eaton had to do with the affairs of William
B. Copeland, a gentleman whose shoulder did not,
on the instant, seem to present itself as a likely object
for the laying on of hands. But Eaton was
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming to the matter of outside investments,
there&#8217;s Kinney&#8217;s ivory cement. The Kinney Manufacturing
Company&#8217;s a client of mine, and it
wouldn&#8217;t be proper for me to express an opinion
even to you, Amidon, on the stability of its
patents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Amidon, &#8220;everybody thinks Kinney&#8217;s
making all the money there is; he&#8217;d have to,
to put as much jam on his bread as he&#8217;s spreading.
I meet his road men now and then, and they
sob because they can&#8217;t fill orders. They&#8217;re not
looking for new business; they&#8217;re shaking hands
with the customers they&#8217;ve already got and telling
&#8217;em to sit at the freight house until the factory
catches up with orders. And before he hit that
cement, Kinney was bookkeeper in a brickyard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care, Amidon! You must be careful of
your facts even in social conversation. Mr. Kinney
had a small interest in a brickyard, which is very
different. By the way, your opportunities for cultivating
Mr. Copeland&#8217;s acquaintance are rather
restricted? Except on those rare occasions when he
summons you to make sure your orders cover your
expense account, you don&#8217;t see much of him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Oh, he used to give me a jolly occasionally before
I went on the road&mdash;ask me why our ball
team was glued to the tail of the league and things
like that. Once he asked me to look up a good
chauffeur for him&mdash;and I got him a chap who&#8217;d
been a professional racer. I guess that made a hit
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An assumption not wholly unwarranted. I hope
he finds the chauffeur satisfactory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he does; he must like him, for he bails
him out about once a week when he gets pinched
for speeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather unfortunate that you&#8217;re not an inside
man, so you could observe the boss more closely;
not, of course, to the extent of exercising an espionage&mdash;but
it might be possible&mdash;er&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can have an inside job if I want it. My
being on the road was just a try-out, and I&#8217;m not
so keen about hopping ties with the sample-cases.
If I&#8217;m going to tackle the reading you&#8217;ve laid out
for me, I&#8217;ll have to change my job. The head
stock-man&#8217;s quitting to go into heavy chemicals on
his own hook; I guess I could get his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t refuse it without full consideration. My
attitude toward you thus far has been wholly
critical; I&#8217;ve refrained from compliments; but it
would interest me to&mdash;er&mdash;see what you can do
with your brains. I suggest that you learn everything
there is about the business outside and in:
become indispensable, be tolerant of stupidity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
forbearing amid jealousy, and indifferent to contumely;
zealous, watchful, polite, without, let us
say, sissiness. Manners, my dear boy, are appraised
far too low in our commercial life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grin occasioned by these injunctions died on
Amidon&#8217;s face as he realized that the lawyer was in
earnest; but he was very much at sea. Eaton was
a busy man, as his generous office space and the
variety of his paraphernalia testified; just why he
had sought an interview, for the sole reason, apparently,
of extracting a little information and giving
a little advice, caused Amidon to wonder. He was
still wondering when Eaton rose and glanced at the
tiniest of watches, which he carried like a coin in his
trousers pocket and always looked at as though
surprised to find he had it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time for me to be off; arguing a case in Pittsburg
Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened a bag that lay beside him on the floor,
pulled a packet from a drawer and dropped it in,
and told Jerry he might, if he had nothing better to
do, accompany him to the station.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> stood at her window watching a man turn
out of the walk that led from the front door to the
street. Her eyes followed him until the hedge hid
him from sight, and then she sat huddled in the
window-seat, breathing hard from her run upstairs.
She went to her desk and glanced at a page of the
pass-book of a trust company that showed the withdrawal
on June 29 of one thousand dollars from her
savings account. There remained a balance of sixteen
hundred, and she verified the subtraction before
thrusting the book into the bottom of a drawer
under a mass of invitations she meant at some time
to file in a book she kept as a record of her social
activities.</p>

<p>She knew that she had made a mistake, and she
was considering the chances of discovery with a
wildly beating heart. The man she had just closed
the door upon had paid two calls on successive
days. He had represented himself as the attorney
for her brother, held on a charge of murder at
Belleville. He had plausibly persuaded her that it
was only fair for her to help her brother in his distress;
that he was the victim of unfortunate circumstances,
but that an investment of one thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
dollars for his defense would save her the
humiliation of having one of her own flesh and
blood convicted of a murder for which he was in no
wise responsible. It had been intimated in discreet
terms that her relationship to the prisoner could be
hidden; it would even be denied if necessary.</p>

<p>She knew now that she should not have yielded;
that in all fairness to her foster-father she should
have reported this demand to him. In secretly giving
money that represented Christmas and birthday
gifts through half a dozen years, for the defense of
a man she had not heard of since the beginning of
her life with the Farleys, she justified herself with
the thought that it was kinder to her foster-father,
in his invalid condition, to keep the matter from
him. She experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling
the moment the money passed from her hands in
the ten one-hundred-dollar bills the man had
specified.</p>

<p>Farley had been seeing much of his lawyer since
the row over the Kinney luncheon. While his
wrath at her duplicity seemed to pass, she assumed
that he had not forgotten his threat to disinherit
her if she married Copeland.</p>

<p>She was unwontedly attentive, spending much
time reading to him or playing cards. She knew
that he liked having young people about, and she
asked to his room some of the girls and young men
who called on her. She exercised all her arts, which
were many, to keep him cheerful, and if he realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
that the change had been abrupt, and that it dated
from his outburst against Copeland, he made no
sign. She mustn&#8217;t stay in too much, he said; he
didn&#8217;t want to be a burden to her.</p>

<p>Eaton had called shortly after his talk with her
on the golf links, but on a night when Farley was
receiving the attentions of his masseur. He had
spent the evening and had been at pains to make
himself agreeable. Now that Copeland had been
thrust into the background, it occurred to her that
Eaton was worth cultivating. We all maintain more
or less consciously a mental list of people on whom
we feel that we may rely in difficulties; it had occurred
to Nan that in a pinch Eaton would be a
friend worth having.</p>

<p>While it was wholly unlikely that Farley would
ever learn of her transaction with the stranger, it
was nevertheless a possibility that would hang over
her as long as he lived. She sought comfort in the
reflection that the amount was small, and that
Farley had never stinted her; moreover, that it was
her own money, subject to her personal check; but
there was little consolation to be had from such
reasoning. She must talk to some one, and before
dinner she telephoned Eaton and asked him to
come up.</p>

<p>Farley had spent two hours with his lawyer that
day, and from the fact that two of his old friends
had arrived hurriedly in answer to telephonic
summons, she judged that he had been making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
a new will and that these men had been called to
witness it.</p>

<p>He ate his prescribed supper, grumbling at its
slightness, and watched her consume her ampler
meal with his usual expressions of envy at her
appetite.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could eat like that, I&#8217;d be well in a week;
it&#8217;s all rubbish, this infernal diet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we tried disobeying the doctor the other
night when the nurse was out, and you didn&#8217;t sleep
a wink. You&#8217;ll have to be good until the doctor
discharges you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;They know
mighty well they can&#8217;t cure me; they&#8217;re just
hangin&#8217; on to me as long as they can for what they
get out of it. But I may fool &#8217;em yet! My grandfather
lived to be ninety and died then from bein&#8217;
kicked by a horse; and my own father got up to
seventy-eight, and that gives me eight years more,&#8221;
he ended defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you worked harder than they did, papa;
you never used to come home to dinner until
seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; he flared. &#8220;These young
fellows that think four hours make a day&#8217;s work
are fools; you won&#8217;t see them gettin&#8217; very far in the
world, spendin&#8217; their time flyin&#8217; around in automobiles
and playin&#8217; golf all day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, some of the young men don&#8217;t
amount to much,&#8221; she admitted conciliatingly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
&#8220;but there are others who work like nailers. I
suppose Mr. Eaton works as hard as any man in
town; and he doesn&#8217;t need to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t need to?&#8221; Farley caught her up.
&#8220;Every honest man works; a man who doesn&#8217;t
work&#8217;s a loafer and very likely a blackguard. John
Eaton works because he has the brains to work
with! He&#8217;s a rare man, John Eaton. There ain&#8217;t
many men like John, brought up as he was, with
everything easy; but he&#8217;s bucklin&#8217; down to hard
work just the same, like the man he is. You say he&#8217;s
comin&#8217; up? Well, we&#8217;ll let him do the talkin&#8217;.
Maybe he can get a laugh out o&#8217; me; he says some
mighty funny things&mdash;and they&#8217;re mostly true.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began feeling about for the evening paper that
he had dropped at his side when his tray was
brought in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just find the market page and read through the
local stock-list. I noticed they&#8217;ve put a new figure
on White River Trust; I used to be a director in
that company. What&#8217;s that? Two hundred eighty-five?
Let me see, that&#8217;s fifteen dollars more than it
was last January when I bought fifty shares at two-seventy.
She&#8217;ll go three hundred in five years. It&#8217;s
the safest buy in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>His long conference with his lawyer had left him
tired and irritable. His doctor had repeatedly
counseled Nan and the nurse to keep him quiet.
As they seemed to be on perfectly safe ground, she
began reading the financial comment preceding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
general stock and bond list, and finding that he was
interested, she followed it with the letter of a firm
of brokers that buoyantly prophesied a strong upward
movement in the immediate future. She
thought he was listening attentively when he began
murmuring half to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two-eighty-five; she&#8217;s bound to go to three
hundred. Hey? What&#8217;s that rubbish you&#8217;re
readin&#8217;? Wall Street letter? What do I care what
a lot of infernal gamblers say about a better tone
in the market! Those fellows down there don&#8217;t
produce anything; it&#8217;s the boys out here that grow
the corn and feed the pigs that put value in the
paper those fellows down there gamble in! Put
that paper down; I want to talk a little business.
How much money you got?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was like a blow in the face. Her
wits danced nimbly in her effort to find an answer,
to decide just how to meet the issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the housekeeping money?&#8221; she
asked faintly.</p>

<p>Since Mrs. Farley&#8217;s death she had paid the household
bills from a sum deposited to her credit the
first of every month. Beyond asking occasionally
how the bills were running, Farley had never questioned
her as to her expenditures. There was a
special allowance and a generous one for her clothing,
and when she asked for additions to the household
money to renew linen or pay for repairs, it was
always readily forthcoming.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he ejaculated impatiently. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mean the house money. How much you got in the
trust company&mdash;the savings you&#8217;ve been gettin&#8217;
three per cent on? You must have over two thousand
dollars there. I been meanin&#8217; to ask you about
that; you&#8217;ve got too much to keep at three per
cent, and we ought to put it into securities of some
kind. Run along and get your pass-book. If you
haven&#8217;t got enough to buy ten shares of White
River Trust stock, I&#8217;ll bring it up a little so you can
have an even number.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was absorbed in mental calculations and did
not notice the reluctance with which she rose and
walked toward her room. The trust company required
that books be presented when withdrawals
were made, and she remembered the appearance
of the teller&#8217;s notation. Farley had never looked at
her pass-book since the day she brought it home
and proudly displayed it. It was the unkindest fate
that had turned his mind upon it at this juncture,
and she canvassed all possible explanations: necessary
expenditures in excess of her household and
personal accounts; unusual repairs which she might
pretend she had not wanted to trouble him with in
his illness; or benevolences&mdash;the latter, she fancied,
more likely to appease than the others in view of
his own generosity to causes that appealed to him.
She decided that a frank confession followed by an
appeal to sentiment was the likeliest means of staying
his anger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>She waited twisting her hands nervously, while
he examined the book.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s this mean, Nan? You
took out a thousand dollars in one lump&mdash;to-day!
My God, what does this mean? What kind of investments
you makin&#8217;, Nan? Yesterday you had
with interest&mdash;lemme see&mdash;twenty-six hundred
dollars, and now you&#8217;ve cut it down to sixteen
hundred! What you spendin&#8217; that money for,
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, papa,&#8221; she began with the best air of
frankness she could summon, &#8220;something very
strange and sad has happened. I meant to tell you
all about it just as soon as you were stronger, but
I&#8217;m glad to tell you now, for I know you will understand
and sympathize&mdash;as you&#8217;ve always done
whenever I&#8217;ve had my little troubles&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to be taking this in good part until
&#8220;troubles&#8221; caused him to sniff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Troubles! What troubles you ever had? I
guess there ain&#8217;t a girl in town that&#8217;s had less
trouble than you have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I didn&#8217;t mean it that way, papa; I
mean only the little things, little mistakes and slips
I&#8217;ve made that you and mamma have always been
kind about. No girl was ever treated as kindly as
you have treated me. And I mean always to be
perfectly frank with you; and I&#8217;m going to be
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>She felt that her contemplated explanation had
been well chosen, but she must be adroit, risking no
word that might spoil the effect of her disclosure.</p>

<p>She knelt beside him and began in a tone that
was eloquent of humility, yet with a confidence
that she hoped would not be lost upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, papa, when you brought me home
with you, and you and mamma began caring for
me, I was just a poor little waif, ready for an orphan
asylum. My father and mother would never have
been able to do anything for me if they had lived;
and if it hadn&#8217;t been for you and mamma, I&#8217;d never
have known any of the things I&#8217;ve learned through
you. I might have been a dining-room girl right
now in some cheap hotel if you hadn&#8217;t opened your
doors and your hearts to me. And that has made
me appreciate my blessings&mdash;all the comforts and
luxuries you have given me. And it has made me
feel, more than you may imagine, for people not so
lucky as I am&mdash;the under dog that gets kicked by
everybody. And even when people are wicked and
do evil things, I think we ought to think kindly of
them and help them when we can. I know you
and mamma always practiced that. And I&#8217;ve tried
to; I really have!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes and there were tears in them,
that seemed to be born of a deep compassion, a
yearning toward all the poor and erring among
mankind. Farley was not unmoved by this demonstration;
he shifted his legs uneasily under the light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
pressure of her arms. Her spell upon him had never
been more complete; she felt that she might risk
much in the mood to which she had brought him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know, papa, I have thought a great
deal about my brother&mdash;who drifted away with
the flood. I haven&#8217;t seen him since father and
mother died. Tom is much older than I am, and the
poor boy never had any chance. I hadn&#8217;t even
heard of him since you brought me away until the
other day. And he&#8217;s in trouble, very deep, serious
trouble, papa; he&#8217;s been arrested&mdash;I&#8217;m sure not
for anything he really did; but being poor and without
friends it was perfectly natural for him to ask
me to help him. I think you will agree to that.
And he sent his lawyer to ask me for money to use
in defending him. I meant to tell you all about it
when you were well; I felt sure I was doing right
and that you&#8217;d be glad to have me help him; and
it&#8217;s all so horrible&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt his form grow rigid, felt his hands
roughly push her away, as he blurted hoarsely:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackmail! My God, it&#8217;s blackmail&mdash;or else
you&#8217;re lyin&#8217; to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and faced him tearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;He&#8217;s my
brother&mdash;the only one of my family that&#8217;s left.
You wouldn&#8217;t have me refuse to help&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help him! Turn a thousand dollars of your
savings over to a worthless whelp that&#8217;s got into
jail! How do you know he&#8217;s your brother?&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
man that waits all these years before he shows
himself and then plumps down on you for a
thousand dollars! I tell you it&#8217;s blackmail, blackmail!
And you hide all this from me just as though
I hadn&#8217;t any right to know what kind o&#8217; trouble
you get mixed up in! Ain&#8217;t you got sense enough to
know you&#8217;re touchin&#8217; bottom when you give up
money that way? What&#8217;s he threatened you with?
You tell me everything there is to know about this,
and I&#8217;ll find out mighty quick whether a contemptible
scoundrel can come to my house and
carry away a thousand dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley glared at her unpityingly while she told
her story, which seemed preposterously weak when
reduced to plain terms. She sobbingly admitted
her fear of newspaper notoriety, her wish to shield
him from the shame of her connection with a man
awaiting trial for murder. There was no mercy in
his eyes; he was outraged that she had again deceived
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid o&#8217; havin&#8217; your name in the papers, were
you? Just as though blackmailers didn&#8217;t always
use that club on the fools they rob! And how many
times do you think a man like that will come back,
now he knows you&#8217;re easy&mdash;now you&#8217;ve gone into
business with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid knocked at the door and announced
Eaton, but Farley gave no heed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Payin&#8217; blackmail! You&#8217;ve got yourself into a
nice mess! And after all I&#8217;ve done to protect you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and make a decent woman of you, you&#8217;re scared to
death of havin&#8217; some of your relations go to jail&mdash;just
as though you hadn&#8217;t turned your back on the
whole set when we brought you here and gave you
our name. That <i>ought</i> to have made you respectable,
if it didn&#8217;t! Afraid of newspapers, afraid of
jackleg lawyers! It&#8217;s the rottenest case of blackmail
I ever heard! And here I&#8217;ve been proud to
think that we&#8217;d pulled you out of the river mud
and made a high-minded woman of you, that could
stand up with any girl anywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited listening to his deep breaths, watching
his tremulous hands; and then without attempting
to answer his indictment, she said
meekly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it was a mistake, papa. I ought to
have told you about it; but it&#8217;s my trouble&mdash;you
must remember that! The shame of the exposure
would be something I&#8217;d have to bear alone; that
was the way I looked at it; and I didn&#8217;t want you
to have the worry of it when you were just beginning
to get well.&#8221;</p>

<p>His thoughts had wandered away from her,
playing about her offense in its practical and legal
aspects. When she ventured to remind him of
Eaton&#8217;s presence in the house, he made no reply.
The silence became intolerable and she stole from
the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>WELCOME CALLERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> decided to explain to Eaton that Farley&#8217;s
illness had taken a turn for the worse and that he
had been abusing her as a relief from his suffering.
She was surprised to find two men in the parlor,
the second of whom she did not at once recognize as
Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the liberty,&#8221; Eaton began, &#8220;of
bringing Mr. Amidon along. Thought you wouldn&#8217;t
mind, particularly as I couldn&#8217;t have come myself
without him. He dropped in just as I was
leaving and seemed greatly depressed; I hadn&#8217;t the
heart to leave him. Depression is his normal state&mdash;no
serenity, no hope, no vision!&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidon grinned during this explanation, realizing
that its lack of veracity was, in the circumstances,
peculiarly Eatonesque and attributable to
his friend&#8217;s wish to relieve Nan of embarrassment.
They had been uncomfortable from the moment
the maid admitted them and they became conscious
of the discord above. Words and phrases of
Farley&#8217;s furious arraignment had reached them and
there was no escaping the conclusion that she had
been the object of the castigation. Jerry, acting
on his own impulses, would have grabbed his hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and bolted. It was only the demeanor of his idol,
placidly staring at the wall, that held him back.
The call had been suggested by Eaton as a gay social
adventure, but it was disconcerting to find a
girl whose good fortune had seemed so enviable
with tears in her eyes, nervously fingering a moist
handkerchief, and Jerry&#8217;s wits were severely taxed
by his efforts to meet a situation without precedent
in his experience. Once he had called on a girl whose
father came home drunk and manifested an ambition
to destroy the furniture and use the pieces in
the chastisement of his daughter, and Amidon had
enjoyed a brief, decisive engagement with the inebriated
parent and had then put him to bed. But
there was nothing in that incident that bore in the
slightest degree upon the difficulties of people who
lived in the best street in town, where, he had always
assumed, the prosperous householders dwelt in
peace and harmony with their fortunate families.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, both of you,&#8221; she said,
with all the assurance she could muster. &#8220;Papa&#8217;s
been having a bad time; you must have heard him
talking. He&#8217;s very angry. I wish you&#8217;d go up,
Mr. Eaton, and see if you can&#8217;t talk him into a
better humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it&#8217;s all right&mdash;&#8221; Eaton began
dubiously; but he was amused at Nan&#8217;s cheerful
willingness to turn her angry foster-parent over to
him for pacification. It was like Nan!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;d been looking forward to seeing you,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
she answered quite honestly. &#8220;These spells don&#8217;t
last long; the very sight of you will cheer him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not, however, offer to accompany him to
Farley&#8217;s room, but discreetly left him to test the
atmosphere for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Jerry remarked, when he was alone with
Nan, &#8220;Pittsburg put it over on New York to-day.
Three to nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave the score with a jubilant turn to the
&#8220;nothing,&#8221; as though Pittsburg&#8217;s success called for
universal rejoicing.</p>

<p>Nan, intent upon catching some hint of the nature
of Eaton&#8217;s reception, merely murmured her
mild pleasure in this news. She was satisfied, from
the calm that reigned above, that Eaton had begun
well, and that under the spell of his presence Farley
would soon be restored to tranquillity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry Mr. Farley is having a bad time,&#8221; Jerry
went on, thinking the invalid&#8217;s outbreak required
at least a passing reference. &#8220;You know down at
the store the boys still talk about him. Somebody&#8217;s
always telling how he used to do things, and the
funny things he used to say. When I first struck
the plant, he used to scare me to death, sticking
his nose in the shipping-room without notice and
catching the boys larking. Once I had gone to the
mat with a plumber that was looking for a gas-leak,
and the boss came in and got us both by the
collar and threw us down the stairs like a pair of
old shoes. I thought I was a goner for sure when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
sent for me to come to the office that night and
asked me who started the trouble. I told him the
plumber said whenever he found gas-leaks in jobbing
houses he always reckoned somebody was getting
ready to collect the insurance. Uncle Tim&mdash;that&#8217;s
what the boys call him&mdash;asked me if I&#8217;d hit
him hard, and I told him I guess he&#8217;d have considerable
business with the dentist, all right. Just for
that he raised my wages a dollar a week! Say, can
you beat it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers and shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that rank&mdash;just after Cecil lectured me
all the way up here about cutting out slang! I
promised him solemnly before we started that I
wouldn&#8217;t say <i>say</i>; and here I&#8217;ve already done it!
How do you learn to talk like white folks, anyhow?
I suppose you got to be born to it; it must be like
swimming or rowing a boat, that you learn once and
always catch the stroke right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shouldn&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; replied
Nan consolingly. &#8220;I use a good deal of slang
myself; and at school my English teacher said
it wasn&#8217;t such a sin if we used it as though we
were quoting&mdash;we girls held up two fingers&mdash;so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds reasonable, all right; I must tell
my noble knight about that. It seems sometimes
as though I just couldn&#8217;t get a ball over the plate&mdash;there
I go again! And Cecil warned me specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
against talking like a bleacher hoodlum when we
got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s not worth bothering about. I&#8217;m so
glad to see you that I could cry for joy. If you
hadn&#8217;t come when you did, I don&#8217;t know what
might have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been trying to direct the talk into other
channels, and her remark puzzled him. That this
wholly charming, delightful Nan could have given
her benefactor cause for the objurgations he had
heard poured out upon her was unbelievable. Still,
it was rather pleasant than otherwise to find that
she was human, capable of tears, and it was not
less than flattering that she should invite his
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began cautiously, &#8220;I guess we all have
our troubles. Life ain&#8217;t such an easy game. You
think you&#8217;re sailing along all right, and suddenly
something goes wrong and you&#8217;ve got to climb out
and study astronomy through the bottom of the
machine. Why,&#8221; he continued expansively, finding
that he had her attention, &#8220;when I first went on the
road I used to get hot when I struck some mutt
who pulled lower prices on me or said he was over-stocked.
But you don&#8217;t sell any goods by getting
mad. I picked up one of these &#8216;Keep Smiling&#8217;
cards somewhere, and when I got blue I used to
take a sneaking look at it and put on a grin and tell
the stony-hearted merchant the funniest story I
could think of and prove that our figures f.o.b.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Peanutville were cheaper, when you figured in the
freight, than Chicago or Cincinnati prices. I&#8217;ve
made a study of freight tariffs; I can tell you the
freight on white elephants all the way from Siam to
Keokuk and back to Bangkok. I&#8217;ve heard the old
boys down at the store talk about Farley till I know
all his curves. Farley&#8217;s all right; there&#8217;s nothing
the matter with Uncle Tim; only&mdash;you don&#8217;t want
to shift gears on him too quick. You&#8217;ve got to do
it gentle-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan smiled forlornly, but Amidon was glad that
he could evoke any sort of smile from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all my fault,&#8221; she said. And then with
a frankness that surprised her she added: &#8220;I had
deceived him about something and he caught me
at it. He gave me a big blowing-up, and I deserved
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say <i>that</i>; but, of course,
playing the game straight was always a big card
with him. I guess Cecil will smooth him down.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was surprised to find herself talking to him
so freely; his eagerness to take her mind away from
the unpleasant episode with Farley gave her a comforting
sense of his native kindliness. Her heart
warmed with liking for him as she reappraised his
good looks, his well-scrubbed appearance of a boy
turned out for his first party by a doting mother;
his general air of wholesomeness and good humor.
He had known hard knocks, she did not question,
but the bruises were well hidden. With all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
slanginess and volubility there was a certain high-mindedness
about him to which, in her hunger for
sympathy, she gave fullest value.</p>

<p>He was afraid of her further confidences; afraid
that she would disclose something she would regret
later, and this he foresaw might embarrass their
subsequent relations. She had been humiliated by
Farley&#8217;s abuse, and it was not fair, he argued, to
take advantage of her present state of mind by
allowing her to tell more of the trouble. But he
was not able at once to change the current of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she said, sitting up straight and
folding her hands on her knees, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking
a lot of things since I saw you out there by the river&mdash;about
old times, and wondering whether it was
good or bad luck that took me away from Belleville
and brought me up here. I&#8217;d have been better off if
I&#8217;d stayed there. I&#8217;d probably have been washing
dishes in the Belleville hotel if the Farleys hadn&#8217;t
picked me up, a dirty little beggar, and tried to
make something decent out of me! I&#8217;m saying
that to you because you know all about me. You&#8217;ve
made your own way, and you&#8217;re a lot happier than
I am, and you&#8217;re not under obligations to anybody;
and here I am trying to climb a ladder my feet
weren&#8217;t made for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut all that out!&#8221; he expostulated. &#8220;Just because
Uncle Tim&#8217;s been a little fretful, you needn&#8217;t
think everything&#8217;s gone to the bow-wows. And as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
for staying in Belleville, why, the thought of it
gives me shivers! There ain&#8217;t any use talking about
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face expressed relief at the vigor with which
he sprang to her defense, and he plunged ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, speaking of dining-room girls, there was a
girl at that Belleville hotel that was some girl for
sure. She was fruit to the passing eye, and a mutt
carrying samples for a confectionery house called
her Gladys one day, her real name being Sarah, and
asked her how she&#8217;d like going to the movies with
him after she got the dishes washed; and she
landed one order of poached cold-storage eggs on
his bosom the neatest you ever saw. Some men
never learn how to size up character, and any fool
could &#8217;a&#8217; told that that girl wasn&#8217;t open to a jolly
from a sweet-goods peddler who&#8217;d never passed
that way before. Sarah&#8217;s mother owns the hotel,
and Sarah only helps in the dining-room Saturday
nights to let the regular crockery-smasher off to
punch the ivories for the Methodist choir practice.
I was sitting next that chap and he thought he&#8217;d
show me what a winner he was. I&#8217;m not justifying
Sarah&#8217;s conduct, and about a half-portion of the
golden side of that order caught me on the ear. I
merely mention it to show you that you had better
not think much of the life of the dining-room girl,
which ain&#8217;t all the handbills make out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; remarked Nan, &#8220;that she didn&#8217;t break
the plate!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;No more,&#8221; he came back promptly, &#8220;than you
could break a ten-dollar bill at a charity fair.
That&#8217;s another thing I learned from Cecil. He got
me to take a stroll with him through a charity
bazaar last winter&mdash;just to protect him from the
snares of the huntress, he said. He started in with
ten tens and had to borrow five I was hiding from
my creditors before we got back to the door. And
all we carried out of the place was a pink party-bag
Cecil handed a tramp we found freezing to death
outside and hoping a little charity would ooze
through the windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at the fancy-work counter at the fair,&#8221;
said Nan, &#8220;and I remember that Mr. Eaton bought
something. I didn&#8217;t see you, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that you didn&#8217;t; I was plumb scared
you might! There I go again! <i>Plumb scared!</i> Oh,
Cecil, if you had heard me then!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was wondering just how he happened to be
sitting in a parlor on a fashionable street, talking to
the only girl he had ever known whose name figured
in the society columns, quite as jauntily as he talked
with any of the stenographers or salesgirls he knew.
He was confident that parlor conversation among
the favored of heaven was not of the sort he had, in
his own phrase, been &#8220;handing out.&#8221; This thought
gave him pause. He shook his cuffs from under the
sleeves of his blue serge coat with a gesture he had
caught from Eaton, and felt nervously of the knot
of his four-in-hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Nan was asking herself whether the fact that a
young fellow of Amidon&#8217;s deficiencies could interest
and amuse her wasn&#8217;t pretty substantial proof
that he was the kind of young man the gods had
designed for her companions. A year ago she would
have resented his appearance in the house; to-night
she had a feeling that his right to be there was as
sound as her own. A different fling of the dice, and
it might have been he whom the Farleys rescued
from poverty and obscurity.</p>

<p>In spite of his absurdities, she was conscious of
definite manly qualities in him. Several times she
caught him scrutinizing her sharply, as though
something about her puzzled him and gave him concern.
His manners were very good&mdash;thanks, perhaps,
to his adored Eaton; and she liked his clean,
fresh look and good humor. After her talk with
Eaton on the golf links, she had wondered whether
the lawyer wasn&#8217;t making a butt of him; but she
dismissed this now as unjust to Eaton, and as appraising
Amidon&#8217;s intelligence at too low a figure.
During this reverie he waited patiently for her to
speak, imagining that her mind was still upon her
troubles, and when the silence became prolonged
he rallied for a fresh attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d rather read,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
hang up the silence sign the way they have it in the
library reading-room and I&#8217;ll say prayers till Cecil
comes down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pardon me!&#8221; she laughed contritely. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
see I am treating you as an old friend. Why don&#8217;t
you go on and talk. You&#8217;ve had ever so many interesting
adventures, and I need to be amused.
Please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m always like this; I hope
you&#8217;ll see me some time when I&#8217;m not in the
dumps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be afraid to,&#8221; he retorted boldly; and
then feeling that Eaton would have spurned such
banality, ejaculated: &#8220;Oh, rot! Let me scratch that
out and say something decent. Just for instance,&#8221;&mdash;and
his face sobered,&mdash;&#8220;I think you&#8217;re nice!
You were perfectly grand to me that day down on
the river. I told Cecil about that, and I could see
it made a hit with him; it set me up with him&mdash;that
a girl like you would be polite to a scrub
like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not proud of
myself: I&#8217;m a failure, a pretty sad fizzle, at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ignored his rapid phrases of protest and
asked him how much time he spent in town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m likely to spend a good deal, from now
on. The boss has been shaking things up again, and
he called me in by telephone yesterday and changed
my job. That&#8217;s the way with him; he won&#8217;t show
up sometimes for six weeks, and then he gets down
early some morning and scares everybody to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was settled on the road for the rest
of my life, and now he&#8217;s made a job for me to help
the credit man&mdash;who doesn&#8217;t want me&mdash;and
take country customers out to lunch. A new job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
made just for my benefit. And all because of a
necktie Cecil gave me. The boss saw me sporting
it one day and asked me where I got it. I had to
make a show-down, and he thought I was kidding
him. You see Cecil&#8217;s about the last man he&#8217;d ever
think of giving me presents. If I&#8217;d laid that necktie
on any other living human being, it wouldn&#8217;t
have cut a bit of ice; but when I said, as fresh as
paint, &#8216;John Cecil Eaton picked that up in New
York for me,&#8217; he laughed right out loud. &#8216;What&#8217;s
the joke?&#8217; I asked him; and he says, &#8216;Oh, Eaton
never gave me any haberdashery, and I&#8217;ve known
him all my life.&#8217; And like the silly young zebra I
am, I came back with, &#8216;Well, maybe that&#8217;s the
reason!&#8217; You&#8217;d have thought he&#8217;d fire me for that;
but it seemed to sort o&#8217; make us better acquainted.
He&#8217;s the prince, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been trying, more or less honestly, to
put Copeland out of her mind. Her knowledge of
him as a business man had been the haziest; one
never thought of Billy Copeland as a person preoccupied
with business. She was startled when
Amidon asked abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you know the boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was possible that Amidon had heard the gossip
that connected her name with his employer&#8217;s, and
she answered carelessly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I know Mr. Copeland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess everybody knows William B.,&#8221; said
Amidon. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the pep&mdash;unadulterated cayenne;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
he isn&#8217;t one of these corpses that are holding
the town back. He&#8217;s a live wire, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, realizing that he had ventured upon thin
ice in mentioning Copeland, he came back to shore
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cecil said that this being my first call, about
thirty minutes would do for me, so I guess it&#8217;s time
for me to skid. He must be handing out a pretty
good line of talk on the upper deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>She begged him not to leave her alone, saying
that Farley lived by rules fixed by his doctor and
that the nurse was likely to interrupt the call at
any minute. As he stood uncertain whether to go
or wait for Eaton, they heard the lawyer saying
good-bye, and in a moment he came down.</p>

<p>Nan looked at him quickly, but was able to read
nothing in his impassive face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you two have been getting better acquainted,&#8221;
Eaton remarked. &#8220;Mr. Farley and I
have had a splendid talk; I never found him more
amusing. One of the most interesting men I ever
knew! What have you been talking about? The
silence down here has been ominously painful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Amidon has been telling me of the egg-throwing
habits of the waitresses in my native town.
Life here in the city is nothing to what it is down
on the river. He&#8217;s almost made me homesick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Amidon,&#8221; said Eaton severely, &#8220;have
you been telling that story&mdash;in a private house?
I thought when I brought you here you&#8217;d be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
your good behavior. I&#8217;m sorry, Nan; I apologize
for him. Of course, he mustn&#8217;t come back; I&#8217;ll see
to it that he doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cruel!&#8221; laughed Nan. &#8220;We got on
beautifully!&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard Farley&#8217;s groans and mutterings as
the nurse put him to bed, and it seemed necessary
to refer to him again before the men left.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind, Nan,&#8221; said Eaton, &#8220;if I say
that Mr. Farley told me the cause of your little
difficulty; I know the whole story. I think he probably
won&#8217;t mention it to you again. I asked him
not to. Just go on as though nothing had happened.
It was unfortunate, of course; but I&#8217;ve persuaded
him that your conduct is pardonable&mdash;really quite
admirable from your standpoint. If anything
further arises in regard to it, I wish you&#8217;d communicate
with me, immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignoring her murmurs of gratitude, he turned to
Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amidon, at this point we shake hands and
move rapidly up the street. And, Nan, you needn&#8217;t
be troubled because Mr. Amidon heard the last
echoes of your difficulty. He&#8217;s perfectly safe,&mdash;discreet,
wise,&mdash;though you&#8217;d never guess it. You
may safely assume that he heard nothing. We must
have some golf, you and I. My game&#8217;s coming up!&#8221;</p>

<p>She went with them to the street door, where
Amidon, in executing a final bow, nearly fell backward
down the steps.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>MRS. COPELAND&#8217;S GOOD FORTUNE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that they had the car, Farley insisted that
Nan should go to market. His wife, like all the
thrifty housewives of the capital, had always gone
to market, and he thought the discipline would be
good for Nan. He liked to accompany her and
watch the crowd while she was doing her errands.</p>

<p>One Saturday, as Nan returned to the machine,
with the chauffeur following with the basket, she
found Fanny Copeland seated in the car beside
Farley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Nan; I&#8217;ve picked up a surprise for
you! We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to take Mrs. Copeland home to
lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you are or not,&#8221; said
Mrs. Copeland. &#8220;This is my busiest day and I&#8217;ve
got to catch the twelve-o&#8217;clock interurban for the
farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that; we&#8217;ll send you home
all right,&#8221; said Farley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m not going to have anything to say
about it at all!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Copeland. &#8220;All right;
if my cows die of thirst, I&#8217;ll send you the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do that, and it will be paid,&#8221; Farley assented
cheerfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to stop at the bank a moment&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;you want to get rid of
the money I just paid at your stand for two yellow-legged
chickens&mdash;you can see the legs sticking out
of the basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland had failed to act upon Nan&#8217;s invitation
to call upon her&mdash;a delinquency to which
she referred now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really meant to come, but I&#8217;ve been unusually
busy. I carry on just enough general farming to be
a nuisance; and dairying requires eternal vigilance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve got a standard,&#8221; said
Farley, with his blunt praise. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got the best
dairy in Indiana. The state inspectors have put it
strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland lightly, &#8220;they gave
me a better report than I deserve just for being a
poor, lone woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley&#8217;s admiration for Mrs. Copeland was perfectly
transparent. It was Fanny&#8217;s efficiency, her
general competence, Nan reflected, quite as much
as her good looks and cheerfulness, that attracted
her foster-father. Several times lately he had
quoted what Bill Harrington, the banker, had said
of her&mdash;that she was the best business man in
town. And there was also Farley&#8217;s contempt for
Copeland, which clearly accentuated his liking for
Billy&#8217;s former wife.</p>

<p>At the bank door Farley remembered that he had
a check to cash and asked Nan to attend to it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
him. As Mrs. Copeland and Nan mounted the bank
steps together, they ran into Billy Copeland emerging
in deep preoccupation. The juxtaposition of
the two women plainly startled him. He took off
his hat, mumbled something, and stood staring
after them. Then his gaze fell upon Farley, bending
forward in the touring-car and watching him
with his small, sharp eyes. He instantly put on his
hat and crossed the walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Farley,&#8221; he said cordially,
offering his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not dead yet,&#8221; growled Farley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
decided to hang on till spring anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone did not encourage conversation. His
face was twisted into a disagreeable smile that
Copeland remembered of old, and there was a hard,
ironic glitter in the gray eyes. Farley had witnessed
the meeting on the bank steps with relish, and was
glad of this opportunity to prolong his enjoyment
of his former associate&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see many more springs, Mr.
Farley. That&#8217;s a good machine you&#8217;ve got there.
The fact that you&#8217;ve taken up motoring has given
a real boost to the auto business. The agents are
saying that if you&#8217;ve got in line there&#8217;s no reason
for anybody to hold back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to have air; I knew all the time that was
what I needed; these damned doctors only keep
people in bed so they can bulldoze &#8217;em easier.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Copeland was attempting to be friendly, but
Farley was in no humor to meet his advances.</p>

<p>&#8220;That last payment on the sale of my stock is
due September first. I won&#8217;t renew it,&#8221; he said
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t asked for an extension,&#8221; Copeland
replied coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then; that will be the end of <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley&#8217;s tone implied that there might be other
matters between them that this final payment would
still leave open.</p>

<p>Copeland&#8217;s ready promise that the twenty-five
thousand would be paid irritated Farley, who saw
one excuse for his animosity vanishing. He leaned
forward and pointed his finger at Copeland, who
was backing away, anxious to be gone before his
former wife reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ruinin&#8217; the house! You&#8217;re lettin&#8217; it go to
hell&mdash;the business your father and I made the best
jobbin&#8217; house in this State! You&#8217;re a drunkard and
a gambler, but, damn your fool soul, there&#8217;s one
thing you can&#8217;t do&mdash;you can&#8217;t marry that little
girl o&#8217; mine! If you&#8217;ve got that up your sleeve, be
sure there&#8217;s no money goes with her for you to
squander! Remember that!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the busiest hour of the day and the street
was thronged. Pedestrians turned and stared curiously.
Copeland raged inwardly at his stupidity
in giving Farley a chance to abuse him publicly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very unjust to me,&#8221; he said hotly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Nan ever since she was a child and
never had any but a friendly feeling for her. I
haven&#8217;t seen her for weeks. Now that I know how
you feel toward me, I have no intention of seeing
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you won&#8217;t see her!&#8221; Farley snorted.
&#8220;Not unless you mean to make her pay for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland and Nan appeared at the bank
entrance at this moment and witnessed the end of
the colloquy. Copeland lifted his hat to Farley and
walked rapidly away without glancing at them.</p>

<p>Farley became cheerful immediately, as he usually
did after an explosion. This opportunity for
laying the lash across Billy Copeland&#8217;s shoulders
had afforded him a welcome diversion; and the fact
that Copeland had seen his former wife in Nan&#8217;s
company tickled his sardonic humor. He made no
reference to Copeland, but began speaking of a
new office building farther down the street. It was
apparent that neither Nan nor Fanny shared his
joy in the encounter and they attacked the architecture
of the new building to hide their discomfort.</p>

<p>Nan appeared the more self-conscious. She was
thinking of Billy. He had turned away from the
machine with a crestfallen air which told her quite
plainly that Farley had been giving him a piece
of his mind. And Nan resented this; Farley had
no right to abuse Billy on her account.</p>

<p>When they reached the house she took Fanny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
upstairs. If the glimpse of Copeland on the bank
steps had troubled Mrs. Copeland she made no
sign. Her deft touches with the comb and brush,
as she glanced in the mirror, her despairing comments
upon the state of her complexion, which, she
averred, the summer suns had ruined; her enthusiasm
over Nan&#8217;s silk waist, which was just the
thing she had sought without avail in all the shops
in town,&mdash;all served to stamp her as wholly
human.</p>

<p>&#8220;But clothes! I hardly have time to think of
them; they&#8217;re an enormous bother. And I wear
the shoes of a peasant woman when I come to town,
for I have to cut across the fields when I leave the
interurban and I can&#8217;t do that in pumps! You
see&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The shoes really were very neat ones, though a
trifle heavy for indoors. Nan instantly brought her
shiniest pumps, dropped upon the floor and substituted
them for Fanny&#8217;s walking-shoes. It flashed
through her mind that Fanny Copeland inspired
just such acts.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the slim foot of the aristocrat,&#8221; observed
Fanny. And then with a wistful smile she
leaned toward the girl and asked, &#8220;Do you mind
if I call you Nan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan was touched by the tone and manner of
her request. Of course there was no objection!</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew I should like you,&#8221; said Fanny.
&#8220;Of course, I haven&#8217;t seen much of you lately, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
I hear of you from a very ardent admirer: John
Eaton talks of you eloquently, and to interest John
Eaton is a real achievement! I&#8217;m afraid I bore him
to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it; he never lets himself be
bored; but like everybody else, I&#8217;m never quite sure
I understand him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I tell him that&#8217;s one of his poses&mdash;baffling
people. He surrounds himself with mystery, but
pretends that he doesn&#8217;t. If he were a gossip
he&#8217;d be horrible, for he knows everything about
everybody&mdash;and knows it first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the kindest of mortals,&#8221; Nan observed.
&#8220;He&#8217;s always doing nice things for people, but he
has to do them in his own peculiar way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John has the spirit of the true philanthropist;
his right hand never knows, you know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a puzzle to the people he&#8217;s kindest to,
sometimes, I imagine,&#8221; said Nan.</p>

<p>She laughed as she thought of Amidon, and Fanny
appealed for illumination as to what amused her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was thinking of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;&mdash;a young
man named Amidon. He and I were kids together,
back in my prehistoric days. He never had any advantages&mdash;if
you can say that of a boy who&#8217;s
born with a keen wit and a sense of humor. He
does something at the Copeland-Farley store&mdash;went
in as errand boy before papa left. They had
him on the road for a while, but he&#8217;s in the office
now. Mr. Eaton has taken a great shine to him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Jerry imitates him killingly. That fine abstracted
air of Mr. Eaton&#8217;s he&#8217;s got nearly perfect; and he
does the mysterious pretty well, too. But he&#8217;s
most delicious when he forgets to Eatonize himself
and is just natural. He&#8217;s quite short&mdash;which
makes him all the funnier&mdash;and he wears tall,
white-wing collars <i>&agrave; la</i> Eaton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me more!&#8221; said Fanny. &#8220;How old is the
paragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About twenty-five, I should say, figuring with
my own age as a basis. He looked like a big boy
to me in my river days. Mr. Eaton has undertaken
his social and mental rehabilitation and the effects
are amazing. They came to the house together to
call, and I&#8217;ve rarely been more entertained than by
Jerry while his good angel was upstairs talking to
papa. He&#8217;s trying to avoid any show of emotion
just like his noble example, but once in a while he
forgets himself and grins deliciously. After a round
of high-brow talk, he drops into reminiscence and
tells the most killing stories of the odd characters
he&#8217;s met in his travels with the sample-case. It
can&#8217;t be possible that Mr. Eaton hasn&#8217;t introduced
him to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m going to complain about
it bitterly,&#8221; said Mrs. Copeland, amused by Nan&#8217;s
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should, for Jerry is a nice boy, and very
wise and kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only one of his benefactions he ever confided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to me was the case of a girl&mdash;the daughter of
an old friend who had fallen on evil times. He
wanted to send her to college, and I became the
visible instrument, so he needn&#8217;t appear in the
matter himself. The girl graduated last year and,
like a fraud, I had to go down to Vassar and pose
as her good angel. She&#8217;s a great success and is to
teach somewhere, I think. But&mdash;I shouldn&#8217;t be
telling you this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s quite safe! I value his friendship too
much to do anything to displease him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, things like that ought to be told,&#8221; remarked
Fanny reflectively; &#8220;particularly when
some people think John Eaton cold and selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luncheon interrupted these confidences. Farley
had not been to the dining-room for several months
and he made much of the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a celebration for me, too,&#8221; said Fanny.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just had a piece of good fortune. Nobody
knows of it yet; you&#8217;re the first people I&#8217;ve told!
You know I haven&#8217;t many friends to confide in.
An aunt of mine has just died and left me some
money. In fact, there&#8217;s a great deal of it; I&#8217;m
richer than I ever expected to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Good!&#8221; Farley ejaculated, interested
and pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Nan; &#8220;and it&#8217;s nice of you to
tell us about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan was afraid that Farley would demand the
amount of the legacy, but evidently Fanny knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
he would be curious as to all the details, and she
went on to explain that it was her mother&#8217;s sister,
the last of the family, who had died recently in
Ohio and left her all her property.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have visited her every year or two since I
was a child and knew her very well, but I never had
any idea she meant to do this. It will take some
time to settle it up, but there&#8217;s as much as two
hundred thousand dollars in sight&mdash;maybe fifty
more. She was a dear old woman; I&#8217;m so ashamed
of myself that I wasn&#8217;t kinder to her, but she was
difficult to handle&mdash;hadn&#8217;t left home for years,
though she used to write to me two or three times
a year. So there! That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m running into the
bank these days, to ask Mr. Harrington about
investments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you take his advice,&#8221; said Farley emphatically,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll never lose any of that money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s to become of the farm?&#8221; asked
Nan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall run it just the same. I&#8217;d rather lose
that legacy than give it up. An unattached woman
like me must have something to amuse herself
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot o&#8217; money; a whole lot o&#8217; money,&#8221;
said Farley; &#8220;and I&#8217;m mighty glad you&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan saw a gleam in his eye and a covert smile
playing about his lips. He chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred; two hundred fifty; that&#8217;s a
whole lot o&#8217; money; and you don&#8217;t want to let any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of these sharks around here get it away from you;
they&#8217;ll be after you all right. But I guess you&#8217;ll
know how to handle &#8217;em,&#8221; he added with satisfaction.</p>

<p>When Fanny was ready to go he called for his
car and he and Nan drove home with her.</p>

<p>That night, after the nurse had put him to bed,
Nan heard an unusual sound from his room. She
crossed the hall and stood in the doorway a moment.
He was muttering to himself and chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Picked up two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, just like findin&#8217; it! Turned her out; got rid
of her! Well, that&#8217;s a hell of a joke on you, Billy
Copeland!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>A NARROW ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a rainy evening in mid-September, a salesman
for an Eastern chemical firm invited Amidon
to join him in a game of billiards at the Whitcomb
House. As Russell Kirby was one of the stars of
the traveling fraternity, Jerry was greatly honored
by this attention. Moreover, when he hung up
his coat in the billiard room and rolled up the
sleeves of his silk shirt, the traveler&#8217;s arms proved to
be thoroughly tanned&mdash;and this impressed Jerry
as indicating that Kirby indulged in the aristocratic
game of golf and did not allow the cares of business
to interfere with his lawful amusements. Kirby
played very good billiards, and did not twist his
cigar into the corner of his mouth when he made
his shots, as most of Jerry&#8217;s friends did.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lid&#8217;s on a little looser in your town than
it was last winter,&#8221; remarked the envied one,
sipping a ricky. &#8220;I suppose by following our noses
we could strike a pretty stiff game without going
out into the wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s always more or less poker around
here,&#8221; replied Jerry, unwilling to appear ignorant
of the moral conditions of his own city.</p>

<p>He chalked his cue and watched Kirby achieve
a difficult shot. Billiards afforded Jerry a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
exercise for his philosophic temper, steady hand,
and calculating eye. He had developed a high degree
of proficiency with the cue in the Criterion
Billiard Parlors. It was a grief to him that in trying
to live up to Eaton he had felt called upon to
desert the Criterion, where the admiration of lesser
lights had been dear to his soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big Rodney Sykes is here,&#8221; Kirby remarked
carelessly. &#8220;They chased him out of Chicago that
last time they had a moral upheaval.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry was chagrined that he knew nothing of
Big Rodney Sykes, presumably a gambler of
established reputation. To be a high-salaried
traveler, with a flexible expense account, was to be
in touch with the inner life of all great cities.
Jerry&#8217;s envy deepened; it availed nothing that he
could beat this sophisticated being at billiards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather tough about that boss of yours,&#8221; Kirby
continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s fellows of his size that Big Rodney
goes after. A gentleman&#8217;s game and no stopping
payment of checks the next morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the boss is no squab; I guess he&#8217;s sat in
with as keen sharps as Sykes and got out with
carfare home,&#8221; replied Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; but on a hot night like this many a
good man feels the need of a little relaxation. It
just happened&#8221;&mdash;he prolonged the deliberation
of his aim to intensify Jerry&#8217;s curiosity&mdash;&#8220;happened
I saw Copeland wandering toward Sykes&#8217;s
room as I was coming down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;I guess the boss knows a thing or two,&#8221; replied
Jerry easily, in a tone that implied unlimited
confidence in Copeland.</p>

<p>He was consumed with indignation that Kirby
should be able to tell him anything about Copeland.
It had been done, too, with a neatness of insinuation
that was galling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess,&#8221; persisted Kirby, &#8220;you miss old
Uncle Tim at the store. I used to have many a
jolly row with Uncle Tim; he was one man it
never paid to fool with; but he was all right&mdash;just
about as clean-cut and straight a man as I
ever fought discounts with. Uncle Tim was a merchant,&#8221;
he ended impressively as he bent over the
table.</p>

<p>In calling Farley a merchant with this air of
finality he implied very clearly that William B.
Copeland was something quite different, and Jerry
resented this imputation as a slur upon his house.
Much as he admired Kirby&#8217;s clothes and metropolitan
ways, he hated him cordially for thus speaking
of Copeland, who was one of Kirby&#8217;s important
customers. Mere defeat was no adequate punishment
for Kirby; Jerry proceeded to make a &#8220;run&#8221;
that attracted the admiring attention of players
at neighboring tables and precluded further discussion
of Copeland.</p>

<p>At midnight Kirby said he had had all the billiards
he wanted and invited Jerry to his room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always like to tell people about their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
town and I&#8217;ll show you where they&#8217;re piling up
the chips,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>His room was opposite the elevator on the
seventh floor, and having unlocked his door he
piloted Jerry round a corner and indicated three
rooms which he said were given over to gambling.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you give the right number of taps that first
door will open,&#8221; said Kirby, &#8220;but as an old friend
I warn you to keep out.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were turning away a telephone tinkled
faintly in one of the rooms and they heard voices
raised excitedly, accompanied by the bang of over-turned
furniture.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a tip the cops are coming or there&#8217;s
a fight,&#8221; said Kirby. &#8220;Here&#8217;s where we fade!&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way quickly back to his room, dragged
Jerry in, and shut the door.</p>

<p>While the sounds of hasty flight continued, the
elevator discharged half a dozen men and they
heard the hotel manager protesting to the police
that it was an outrage; that the rooms they were
raiding had been taken by strangers, and that if
there was anything wrong he wasn&#8217;t responsible.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the return of the prisoners
to the elevator announced the success of the raid.
Several of them were protesting loudly against
riding to the police station in a patrol wagon; others
were taking the whole matter as a joke. Above the
confusion Copeland&#8217;s voice rose drunkenly in denunciation
of his arrest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Kirby, anxious not to be identified even remotely
with the sinners who had been caught in
their transgressions, had taken off his coat and
was lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try one of these, Amidon. We&#8217;d better sit tight
until the cops get out of the building. Nice town
this! Gambling in respectable hotels. No doubt
all those fellows are leading citizens, including&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this instant the electric lights were extinguished.
The darkness continued and Jerry opened
the door and stuck his head out. Half the prisoners
had been sent down and the remainder were waiting
for the elevator to return. They growled dismally
and somebody said it was a good chance to give the
cops the slip.</p>

<p>One of the policemen struck a match and held it
up to light the entrance to the car. Jerry&#8217;s eyes
ran quickly over the group facing the shaft, but
he recognized none of the men. As the match died
out a prolonged, weary sigh near at hand caused
him to start. Some one was leaning against the
wall close beside him. He reached out, caught the
man by the arm, drew him into the room and softly
closed the door.</p>

<p>Kirby demanded to know what Amidon had
done, and during the whispered explanation the
globes began to brighten. Jerry jumped for the
switch and snapped off the lights. He climbed on a
chair and surveyed the hall through the transom.
The last officer was stepping into the elevator, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
some one demanded to know what had become of
Billy Copeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he went down in the first load,&#8221; replied
another voice.</p>

<p>Then the door clanged and the hall was quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn on the lights,&#8221; commanded Kirby.</p>

<p>Copeland sat on the bed, staring at them foolishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherenell am I?&#8221; he asked blinking. &#8220;Thiss
jail or somebody&#8217;s parlor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your nerve, young man,&#8221; Kirby remarked to
Jerry, &#8220;leaves nothing to be desired. I suppose
it didn&#8217;t occur to you that this is my room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be all right. If the cops ain&#8217;t back
here in ten minutes, they&#8217;ll probably think he&#8217;s
skipped; and they won&#8217;t waste time looking for
him; they know they can pick him up to-morrow,
easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zhat you, Kirby, good old boy; right off Broadway!
Kind of you, &#8217;m sure. Good boy, Amidon;
wouldn&#8217;t let your boss get hauled off in patrol wagon.
Raise wages for that; &#8217;preciate it; mos&#8217; grateful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; but please stop talking,&#8221; Jerry admonished.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll all get pinched if the cops find
out you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Los&#8217; five thous; five thou-sand dollars; hons&#8217;
to God I did!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland&#8217;s face was aflame from drink and the
heat, and unable to comprehend what had happened
to him he tumbled over on the bed. Kirby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
eyed him contemptuously and turned upon Amidon
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a nice mess of cats! Would you mind
telling me what you&#8217;re going to do with our fallen
brother? Please remember that reputation&#8217;s my
only asset, and if I get arrested my house might
not pass it off as a little joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, cheer up and be a good sport! I know the
boys at the desk downstairs and I&#8217;m going to tell
&#8217;em you&#8217;ve cleared out to make way for an old
comrade of the Army of the Potomac. I&#8217;ll have
you moved, and then I&#8217;ll put the boss to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to please you,&#8221; said Kirby ironically,
as Copeland began to snore. &#8220;Your boss is lying on
my coat and I hope you&#8217;ll have the decency to pay
for pressing it!&#8221;...</p>

<p>At ten the next morning Amidon called at the
Whitcomb and found Copeland half dressed. He
had telephoned to his house for toilet articles and
clean linen and presented the fresh and chastened
appearance with which he always emerged from his
sprees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d drop in,&#8221; said Jerry, seating himself
in the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been to the store?&#8221; asked Copeland from before
the mirror where he was sticking a gold safety pin
through the ends of a silk collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I took a look in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any genial policeman lying in wait for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing! Everything&#8217;s all fixed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Fixed? How fixed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know the way around the pump at the
police court, and I had a bum lawyer who hangs
out there make the right sign to the judge. You
owe me forty-seven dollars&mdash;that includes ten
for the lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheap at the price,&#8221; remarked Copeland. He
had taken a check book from the table and was
frowningly inspecting the last stub.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come to collect,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;Any
old time will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did the rest of the boys come out?&#8221; asked
Copeland, throwing the book down impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the big sneeze from Chicago got a heavy
soaking. The judge took it out on him for the rest
of you. Wouldn&#8217;t do, of course, to send prominent
business men to the work-house. All fined under
assumed names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather expensive evening for me. Much
obliged to you just the same for saving me a ride
in the wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was easy,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;By the way,
I guess we&#8217;d better slip my lawyer friend another
ten. He dug this up for you&mdash;no questions, no
fuss; all on the dead quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew from his trousers pocket a crumpled bit
of paper and handed it to Copeland.</p>

<p>Jerry was not without his sense of the dramatic.
He rolled a cigarette and watched Copeland out of
the corner of his eye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;See here, Jerry,&#8221; said Copeland quickly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know about this. If I gave that check, and I know
I did, I&#8217;ve got to stand by it. It&#8217;s not square&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t burst out crying about that!&#8221;
remarked Jerry easily. &#8220;Five thousand is some
money, and the Chicago shark was glad enough to
have the check disappear from the police safe.
You were stewed when you wrote the check; and
besides, it was a crooked game. Forget it; that&#8217;s
all!&#8221; He stretched himself and yawned. &#8220;Can I
do anything for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Copeland, &#8220;that you&#8217;ve
done about enough for me for one day,&mdash;kept
me out of jail and then saved me five thousand
dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do what we can,&#8221; replied Jerry. &#8220;Keep us
posted and when in doubt make the high sign.
You&#8217;d better keep mum about the check. The
deputy prosecutor&#8217;s a friend of mine and I don&#8217;t
want to get him into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel a little better about that check
to know that it wasn&#8217;t good when I gave it,&#8221;
remarked Copeland dryly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only got about
a hundred in bank according to my stubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; said Jerry, playing with
the curtain cord, &#8220;as I came down from the police
court, that five thousand per night swells the overhead
considerable. This isn&#8217;t a kick; I just mention
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland paused in the act of drawing on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
coat to bestow a searching glance upon his employee.
He shook himself into the coat and rested
his hand on the brass bedpost.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the odds?&#8221; he asked harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
undoubtedly going to hell and a thousand or two,
here and there&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you going?&#8221; asked Jerry, tying a loop
in the curtain cord.</p>

<p>Copeland was not prepared for this; he didn&#8217;t at
once correlate Amidon&#8217;s question with his own
remark that had inspired it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the devil!&#8221; he ejaculated impatiently; and
then he smiled ruefully as he realized that there
was a certain appositeness in his rejoinder.</p>

<p>The relations of employer and employee had
been modified by the incidents of the night and
morning. Copeland imagined that he was something
of a hero to his employees, and that Jerry
probably viewed the night&#8217;s escapade as one of the
privileges enjoyed by the more favored social class.
Possibly in his own way Amidon was guilty of
reprehensible dissipations and therefore disposed
to be tolerant of other men&#8217;s shortcomings. At
any rate, the young fellow had got him out of a bad
scrape, and he meant to do something for him to
show his gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a man&#8217;s got to let loose occasionally,&#8221; he
said, as he began collecting his toilet articles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he has,&#8221; Amidon admitted without
enthusiasm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;I guess I ought to cut out these midnight
parties and get down to business,&#8221; said Copeland,
as though recent history called for some such declaration
of his intentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; Jerry replied. &#8220;You can
let &#8217;er slide if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the house is sliding already?&#8221;
Copeland asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost worse than a slide, if you want to
know. But I didn&#8217;t come here to talk about that.
There&#8217;s plenty of others can tell you more about
the business than I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Copeland, frowning; &#8220;I
suppose&mdash;I suppose maybe they&#8217;re afraid to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right, too,&#8221; Jerry affirmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in a position to learn what&#8217;s going
on. I want to push you ahead. I hope you understand
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you treat me all right,&#8221; said Jerry, but in a
tone that Copeland didn&#8217;t find cheering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to treat everybody right at the store,&#8221;
declared Copeland virtuously. &#8220;If any of the boys
have a kick I want them to come straight to me
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry laid his hand on the door ready for flight
and regarded Copeland soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only kick&#8217;s on you, if you can bear to hear
it. Everybody around the place knows you&#8217;re not
on the job; every drayman in the district knows
you&#8217;re out with a paintbrush every night, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
solid men around town are saying it&#8217;s only a matter
of time till you go broke. And the men down
at the store are sore about it; it means that one of
these mornings there&#8217;ll be a new shift and they&#8217;re
likely to be out of a job. Some of them have been
there a long time, and they don&#8217;t like to see the
old business breaking down. And some of them, I
guess, sort o&#8217; like you and hate to see you slipping
over the edge.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this speech Copeland stood with his
cigarette-case half opened in his hand, looking
hard at the top button on Amidon&#8217;s coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, thrusting a cigarette into his
mouth and tilting it upwards with his lips while he
felt for a match, &#8220;go on and hand me the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s about all from me,&#8221; replied Jerry,
&#8220;except if you want to bounce me right now, go
ahead, only&mdash;let&#8217;s don&#8217;t have any hard feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland made no reply, and Jerry went out
and closed the door. Then in a moment he opened
it, saw Copeland staring out across the roofs in
deep preoccupation, and remarked, deferentially:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry your bag down, sir. Shall I order a
taxi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Copeland, with affected
carelessness; &#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to it. I&#8217;m going to the
store.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>THE AMBITIONS OF MR. AMIDON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> other branch of commerce is as fascinating
as the wholesale drug business. A drug stock embraces
ten thousand small items, and the remote
fastnesses of the earth are raked to supply its necessities.
The warehouses are redolent of countless
scents that pique a healthy curiosity; poppy and
mandragora and all the drowsy sirups of the world
are enlisted in its catalogue. How superior to the
handling of the grosser commodities of the wholesale
grocery line! How infinitely more delightful
than distributing clanging hardware or scattering
broadcast the unresponsive units of the dry-goods
trade!</p>

<p>Such, at least, were Jerry Amidon&#8217;s opinions.
Jerry knew his way around the store&mdash;literally.
He could find the asaf&#339;tida without sniffing his
way to it. He had acquired a working knowledge
of the pharmacop&#339;ia, and under Eaton&#8217;s guidance
he purchased a Latin grammar and a dictionary,
over which he labored diligently in the midnight
hours. His curiosity was insatiable; he wanted to
know things!</p>

<p>&#8220;Assistant to the President&#8221; was the title bestowed
upon him by his fellow employees. By imperceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
degrees he had grown into a confidential
relationship with Copeland that puzzled the whole
establishment. The latest shifts had been unusually
productive of friction, and Amidon had found
his new position under the credit man wholly uncomfortable.
Having asserted his authority, Copeland
gave no heed to the results. The credit man
was an old employee, very jealous of his prerogatives,
and he had told Jerry in blunt terms that he
had nothing for him to do. The auditor thereupon
pounced upon him and set him to work checking
invoices.</p>

<p>Jerry wrote a good hand and proved apt, and as
a result of this contact with the office he absorbed
a vast amount of information pertaining to the
business to which, strictly speaking, he was not
entitled. Copeland, seeing him perched on a stool
in the counting-room, asked him what he was doing
there, and when Jerry replied that he was just
helping out for a day or two, Copeland remarked
ironically that he guessed he&#8217;d better stay there;
that he&#8217;d been thinking for some time that fresh
blood was needed in that department.</p>

<p>No one else entered Copeland&#8217;s office with so
much assurance. If Jerry hadn&#8217;t been so amiable,
so willing to help any one who called for his assistance,
he would have been cordially hated; but
Jerry was a likable fellow. He prided himself on
keeping cheerful on blue Mondays when everybody
else about the place was in the doldrums.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The auditor sent him to the bank frequently,
and he experienced a pleasurable sensation in walking
briskly across the lobby of the Western National.
He knew many of the clerks he saw immured
in the cages; some of them were members
of the Little Ripple Club, and he made a point of
finding out just what they did, and incidentally the
amount of their salaries, which seemed disgracefully
inadequate; he was doing quite as well himself.
He liked to linger in the bank lobby and talk
to people. He had hit on the happy expedient of
speaking to men whether he knew them or not; he
argued that in time they would ask who he was,
which was a surer way of impressing himself upon
them than through formal introductions.</p>

<p>Ambition stirred in the bosom of Jeremiah A.
Amidon. He lavished his admiration upon the
&#8220;big&#8221; men of the &#8220;street&#8221;&mdash;in the main they
were hard workers, and he was pretty well persuaded
of the virtue and reward of industry.</p>

<p>Nearly all the leading manufacturers and merchants
were stockholders in banks. The fact that
Copeland enjoyed no such distinction troubled
Jerry. He studied the stock-list, hoping to see
something some day that he could buy.</p>

<p>The local stock exchange consisted of three gentlemen
calling themselves brokers. Whenever they
met by chance on the steps of the Western National
or in a trolley going home, the exchange was
in session. The &#8220;list&#8221; must be kept active, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
when there were no transfers the brokers could
trade a few shares with one another to establish a
price. These agitations of the local bourse would
be duly reported on the market page of the newspapers&mdash;all
but the number of shares changing
hands! &#8220;A better tone prevailing&#8221;; &#8220;brisk demand
for tractions&#8221;; &#8220;lively trading in industrials&#8221;
would soberly greet the eye of students of
local financial conditions.</p>

<p>Foreman, one of the brokers, who had been
haunting the store for several days looking for
Copeland, accosted Jerry in the bank one afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your boss doesn&#8217;t sit on his job much,&#8221; Foreman
remarked. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting tired chasing him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off motoring with Kinney&mdash;they&#8217;re
looking for a place to start another cement mill.
Why don&#8217;t you call for me when you honor the
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my business with Copeland is too trifling
to trouble you about,&#8221; the broker remarked ironically.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any money, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry bent his ear to catch the jingle of coin inside
the cages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you want to borrow, Copeland-Farley
ain&#8217;t a pawnshop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess C-F doesn&#8217;t <i>lend</i> much; it&#8217;s the biggest
borrower on the street,&#8221; said Foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every big jobber is a heavy borrower. It&#8217;s a
part of the game,&#8221; Jerry replied. Foreman&#8217;s anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to find Copeland had piqued his curiosity. &#8220;Of
course, if your business with the boss can wait&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trifling matter, that will probably annoy
him when I mention it. I&#8217;ve got twenty shares of
Copeland-Farley for sale. I thought he might want
to pick &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be a mistake,&#8221; replied Jerry indifferently;
&#8220;there&#8217;s never any of our stock for sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I suppose you&#8217;ve got most of it yourself
downstairs in the safety vault!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come through and pour the dope!&#8221; said Jerry,
grinning cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all right. An old party named
Reynolds up at Fort Wayne had twenty shares
and his executors wrote me that Copeland ought to
have a chance to buy &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve worn myself out
trying to find your boss. I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;d buy
if he didn&#8217;t. The things you hear about your house
are a little bit scary: trade falling off; head of the
company drinking, gambling, monkeying with outside
things, like Kinney cement&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; Jerry chirruped; &#8220;you&#8217;re just
chuck full of sad tidings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you know it all; but maybe you
don&#8217;t know that Corbin &amp; Eichberg are cutting into
your business. There will be an involuntary consolidation
one of these days and Copeland-Farley
will be painted off the sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the best little booster I&#8217;ve heard sing
this week! What&#8217;ll you take for the stock?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;Par.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold! Bring your papers here to-morrow at two
and I&#8217;ll give you the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry had heard some one say that it was what
you can do without money that proves your mettle
in business. He had one thousand dollars, that represented
the savings of his lifetime. The second
thousand necessary to complete the purchase he
borrowed of Eaton&mdash;who made the advance not
without much questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very careless on Copeland&#8217;s part, but to be
expected of a man who takes only a fitful interest
in his business. You have about one thousand
dollars! All right; I&#8217;ll lend you what you need to
buy the stock. But keep this to yourself; don&#8217;t
turn in the old certificate for a new one&mdash;not at
present. Wait and see what happens. Copeland
needs discipline, and he will probably get it. Kinney
and Copeland seeing much of each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re off on a business trip together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean social affairs. They haven&#8217;t been driving
peaceful citizens away from the Country Club
by their cork-popping quite so much, have they?
I thought not; that&#8217;s good. The general reform
wave may hit them yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the dead, I think Copeland&#8217;s trying to cut
out the early morning parties,&#8221; said Jerry earnestly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s taken a brace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t want to die in the poorhouse at
the early age of fifty, he&#8217;d better!&#8221; Eaton brushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
an imaginary speck off his cuff as he asked, &#8220;How
much did your boss give you of the five thousand
you got back for him out of that poker game?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidon fidgeted and colored deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just another of these fairy stories!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your attempt to feign ignorance is laudable,
Amidon. But my information is exact. Rather
neat, particularly lifting him right out of the patrol
wagon, so to speak. And recovering the check;
creditable to your tact&mdash;highly so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was dead easy! You see, after helping the
gang lick you in the primaries last May, they
couldn&#8217;t go back on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you turned your influence to nobler use,
this would be a very different world! Let us go
back to that Corrigan matter&mdash;you remember?&#8221;
asked Eaton, filling his pipe. &#8220;You probably noticed
that the gentleman who was arrested for
murder down there was duly convicted. His lawyer
didn&#8217;t do him much good. No wonder! I never saw
a case more miserably handled&mdash;stupid beyond
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wasn&#8217;t down there!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry,
sitting up straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Were</i>, not <i>was</i>, Amidon! I should think you&#8217;d
know I&#8217;d been in the wilderness from my emaciated
appearance. Believe I did say I was going
to Pittsburg, but I took the wrong train. Met some
nice chaps while I was down there,&mdash;one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
friends of yours, road agents, pirates, commercial
travelers, drummers,&mdash;I beg your pardon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry was moved to despair. He would never
be able to surround himself with the mystery or
practice the secrecy that he found so fascinating
in Eaton. He had not imagined that the lawyer
would bother himself further about Corrigan. He
had read of the conviction without emotion, but it
would never have occurred to him that a man so
busy as Eaton or so devoted to the comforts of life
would spend three days in Belleville merely to
watch the trial of a man in whom he had only the
remotest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;They soaked him for manslaughter. I guess he
got off easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did, indeed,&#8221; replied Eaton. &#8220;When did
you see Nan last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been there once since you took me, and the
old man sent down word he wanted to see me. He
was feeling good and lit into me about the store.
Wanted to know about everything. Some of the
fellows Copeland has kicked out have been up crying
on Farley&#8217;s doorstep and he asked me how the
boss came to let them go. He sent Nan out of the
room so he could cuss better. He&#8217;s sure some
cusser!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amidon!&#8221; Eaton beat his knuckles on the desk
sharply, &#8220;remember you are speaking English!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better give me up,&#8221; moaned Jerry, crestfallen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;You are doing well. With patience and care
you will improve the quality of your diction. No
reference to the Corrigan matter, I suppose,&mdash;either
by Farley or Nan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word. It was the night I read about the
end of the trial, but nothing was said about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t have worried,&#8221; Eaton remarked.
&#8220;She was a very foolish little girl to have drawn
her money out of the bank to hand over to a
crooked lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you coaxed the money back&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not! It might have been amusing to
gather Harlowe in for blackmail; but you can
see that it would have involved no end of newspaper
notoriety; most disagreeable. I had the best
opportunities for observing that fellow in his conduct
of the case; in fact, I had a letter to the judge
and he asked me to sit with him on the bench.
There&#8217;s little in the life or public services of Jason
E. Harlowe that I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He lifted his eyes
to the solid wall of file-boxes. &#8220;H-66 is filled with
data. Jason E. Harlowe,&#8221; he repeated musingly.
&#8220;If I should die to-night, kindly direct my executor
to observe that box particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him; he ran for the legislature
last year and got licked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By two hundred and sixteen votes,&#8221; added
Eaton.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your guess about that thousand bucks?
Corrigan must have put Harlowe up to it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;He did not,&#8221; replied Eaton, peering for a moment
into the bowl of his pipe. &#8220;It was Mr. Harlowe&#8217;s
idea&mdash;strictly so. And I&#8217;m ready for him
in case he shows his hand again. Farley has some
relations down that way, a couple of cousins at
Lawrenceburg. Do you follow me? Harlowe may
have something bigger up his sleeve. He ranges
the whole Indiana shore of the Ohio; business
mostly criminal. The more I&#8217;ve thought of that
thousand-dollar episode, the less I&#8217;ve liked it. I
take a good deal of interest in Nan, you know.
She&#8217;s a little brash and needs a helping hand occasionally.
Not that I&#8217;m called upon to stand <i>in
loco parentis</i>, but there&#8217;s something mighty appealing
in her. For fear you may misunderstand me, I
assure you that I am not in love with her, or in
danger of being; but her position is difficult and
made the more so by her impulsive, warm-hearted
nature. And it has told against her a little that
the Farleys were never quite admitted to the inner
circle here. This is a peculiar town, you know,
Amidon, and there&#8217;s a good deal of caste feeling&mdash;deplorable
but true! You and I are sturdy democrats
and above such prejudices, but there are a
few people amongst us who never forget what you
may call their position. Unfortunate, but it&#8217;s here
and to be reckoned with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess Nan&#8217;s as good as any of them,&#8221;
said Amidon doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is! But it&#8217;s the elemental strain in her that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
makes her interesting. She&#8217;s of the race that believes
in fairies; we have to take that into account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidon nodded soberly. He had seen nothing in
Nan to support this proposition that she believed
in fairies, but the idea pleased him.</p>

<p>Eaton&#8217;s way of speaking of women was another
thing that impressed Jerry. It was always with
profound respect, and this was unfamiliar enough
in Jerry&#8217;s previous existence; but combined with
this reverential attitude was a chivalrous anxiety
to serve or protect them. The girls Jerry had
known, or the ones he particularly admired, were
those endowed with a special genius for taking
care of themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; Eaton was saying, &#8220;needs plenty of air.
She has suffered from claustrophobia in her life
with the Farleys. Oh, yes; claustrophobia&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused to explain the meaning of the word,
which Jerry scribbled on an envelope that he might
remember it and use it somewhere when opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Farley talked to you. You will find
that he will ask to see you again, but be careful
what you say to him about the store. He&#8217;ll be
anxious to worm information out of you, but he&#8217;s
the sort to distrust you if you seemed anxious to
talk against the house or the head of it, much as he
may dislike him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;He asked
about the customers on the route I worked last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
year and seemed to know them all&mdash;even to the
number of children in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been back once since we called together?
Anybody else around&mdash;any signs that
Nan is receiving social attentions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any. She&#8217;d been reading &#8216;Huck
Finn&#8217; to the old gent when I dropped in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isolated life; not wholesome. A girl like that
needs to have people about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Jerry ejaculated, &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t need a
scrub like me! I felt ashamed of myself for going;
and had to walk around the block about seven
times before I got my nerve up to go in. It&#8217;s
awful, going into a house like that, and waiting for
the coon to go off to see whether the folks want to
see you or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trepidation you indicate is creditable to
you, Amidon. Your social instincts are crude but
sound. Should you say, as a student of mankind
and an observer of life, that Nan is pining away with
a broken heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hardly; she was a lot cheerfuler than she
was that first time, when you went with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the compliment! Of course, you
get on better without me. &#8217;Twas always thus!
Well, that first time was hardly a fair example of
my effect upon womankind. The air was surcharged
with electricity; Nan had made a trifling
error of judgment and had been brought promptly
to book. I&#8217;ve always rather admired people who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
follow their impulses; it&#8217;s my disposition to examine
my own under the microscope. Don&#8217;t check
yourself too much: I find your spontaneity refreshing,
particularly now that your verbs and nouns
are more nearly in agreement. You say Copeland
and Kinney are off motoring, to look at a new
factory?&#8221; He lifted his eyes to one of the file-boxes
absently. &#8220;I wish they&#8217;d wait till we get rid
of that suit over Kinney&#8217;s patents before they
spread out. The case ought to be decided soon and
there are times&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose quickly, walked to the shelves and drew
down a volume in which he instantly became absorbed.
Then he went back to his desk and refilled
his pipe deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;that we shall win the
case; but you never can tell. By the way, what is
your impartial judgment of the merits of Corbin
&amp; Eichberg&mdash;rather wide-awake fellows, aren&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Jerry began to express scorn by a contemptuous
curl of the lip and an outward gesture of his
stiffened palm, Eaton reprimanded him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak judicially; no bluster; none of this whang
about their handling inferior goods. The fact is they
are almost offensively prosperous and carry more
traveling men after ten years&#8217; business than Copeland-Farley
with thirty years behind them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Jerry replied meekly, &#8220;I guess they
are cutting in a little; Eichberg had made a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
money before he went into drugs and they&#8217;ve got
more capital than C-F.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That increases the danger of the competition.
Eichberg is a pretty solid citizen. For example, he&#8217;s
a director in the Western National.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that won&#8217;t help him sell any drugs,&#8221;
said Amidon, who resented this indirect praise of
Corbin &amp; Eichberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not directly; no.&#8221; And Eaton dropped the
subject with a finality Jerry felt bound to accept.</p>

<p>Foreman had intimated that in due course Copeland-Farley
would be absorbed by Corbin &amp; Eichberg;
possibly the same calamity was foreshadowed
in Eaton&#8217;s speculations.</p>

<p>Before he returned to his boarding-house Jerry
strolled into the jobbing district and stood for
some time on the sidewalk opposite Copeland-Farley&#8217;s
store. His twenty shares of stock gave
him an exalted sense of proprietorship. He was
making progress; he was a stockholder in a corporation.
But it was a corporation that was undoubtedly
going to the bad.</p>

<p>It was quite true that Corbin &amp; Eichberg were
making heavy inroads upon Copeland-Farley trade.
They were broadening the field of their operations
and developing territory beyond the farthest limits
to which Copeland-Farley had extended local drug
jobbing. It was not a debatable matter that if
Copeland persisted in his evil courses the business
would go by the board.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Copeland hadn&#8217;t been brought up to work; that
was his trouble, Jerry philosophized. And yet
Copeland was doing better. As Jerry thought of
him his attitude became paternal. He grinned as
he became conscious of his dreams of attempting&mdash;he,
Jeremiah Amidon&mdash;to pull Billy Copeland
back from the pit for which he seemed destined,
and save the house of Copeland-Farley from ruin.</p>

<p>He crossed the street, found the private watchman
sitting in the open door half asleep, roused him,
and gave him a cigar he had purchased for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Then he walked away whistling cheerfully and
beating the walk with his stick.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>CANOEING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> began to move more briskly for Nan. She
was not aware that certain invitations that reached
her were due to a few words carefully spoken in
safe quarters by Eaton.</p>

<p>One of the first large functions of the dawning
season was a tea given by Mrs. Harrington for a
visitor. Mrs. Harrington not only asked Nan to
assist, but she extended the invitation personally
in the Farley parlor, much to Nan&#8217;s astonishment.</p>

<p>One or two young gentlemen who had paid Nan
attentions when she first came home from school
looked her up again. John Cecil Eaton was highly
regarded by the younger men he met at the University
Club, and was not without influence. A
reference to Nan as an unusual person; some saying
of hers, quoted carelessly at the round table, was
instrumental in directing attention anew to her as
a girl worth knowing. If any one said, &#8220;How&#8217;s her
affair with Copeland going?&#8221; Eaton would retort,
icily, that it wasn&#8217;t going; that there never had
been anything in it but shameless gossip.</p>

<p>Jerry now reserved his Thursday evenings for
Nan: not for any particular reason except that
Eaton had taken him to the Farleys on a Thursday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and from sentimental considerations he consecrated
the day to repetitions of the visit. Nan
was immensely kind to him; it was incredible that
a girl so separated from him by immeasurable distances
should be so cordial, so responsive to his
overtures of friendship. Once she sent him a note&mdash;the
frankest, friendliest imaginable note&mdash;to say
that on a particular Thursday evening she could
not see him. His disappointment was as nothing
when weighed against his joy that she recognized
his claim upon that particular evening and took the
trouble to explain that the nurse would be out and
that she would be too busy with Farley to see him.
He replied with flowers&mdash;which brought him another
note.</p>

<p>He had laid before her all his plans for self-improvement
and her encouragement was even more
stimulating than Eaton&#8217;s. She fell at times into
a maternal attitude toward him, scolding and lecturing
him, and he was meek under her criticism.</p>

<p>Nan felt more at home with him than with any
other young man who called on her. With some of
these, whose mothers and sisters had been treating
her coldly, she felt herself to be playing a part&mdash;trying
to assume a dignity that was not naturally
hers in order that they might give a good account
of her at home. With Jerry she could be herself
without dissimulation. When it came to mothers,
he remembered her mother perfectly and she remembered
his. In a sense she and Jerry were allies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
engaged in accommodating themselves to a somewhat
questioning if not hostile atmosphere. In all
her acquaintance he was the one person who could
make the necessary allowances for her, who was
able to give her full credit for her good intentions.</p>

<p>On his seventh call he summoned courage to
ask her to join him on a Saturday afternoon excursion
on the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;The foliage is unusually beautiful this year,&#8221;
he suggested with his air of quoting, &#8220;and it&#8217;ll be
too cold for canoeing pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;&#8221; Nan began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d say that; but you&#8217;re as safe in
my boat as in your own rocking-chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to say that,&#8221; laughed Nan. &#8220;I
was going to say that I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t
enjoy the foliage so much if I were along.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that she was laughing at him. Nan and
Eaton were the only persons whose mirth he suffered
without resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask papa about it; or maybe you&#8217;ll
ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already asked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you ask him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten minutes ago, just before I came downstairs.
I told him two good stories and then shot
it in quick. He said he thought it would do you
good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your nerve! Why didn&#8217;t you ask me
first?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Because it was much more proper for me to
open negotiations with the man higher up. I hope
you appreciate my delicacy,&#8221; he added, in Eaton&#8217;s
familiar, half-mocking tone, which he had caught
perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so thoughtful I suppose you&#8217;ve also
arranged for a chaperone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The canoe,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;is more comfortable
for two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two have been in it rather often, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but that was last summer. I&#8217;ve seen
everything different this season. I practiced casting
on a day in June and met with an experience that
has changed the whole current of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it changed your luck with the rod! You
got snagged on everything that would hold a hook,
but I must say that you bore your troubles in a
sweet spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned that early in the game. Even if you
refused my invitation I&#8217;d try to bear up under it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll decline, then, just to see how you
take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only polite to say it would be a blow.
I have a pocketful of strychnine and it might be
unpleasant to have me die on the doorstep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could stand that probably better than the
neighbors could. You&#8217;d better try a poison that&#8217;s
warranted not to kill on the premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry tortured himself with speculations as to
whether he should hire a taxi to transport them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the Little Ripple Club, but finally decided against
it as an unwarranted extravagance, calculated to
arouse suspicion in the mind of Farley. However,
when he reached the house at two o&#8217;clock on Saturday,
Nan announced that the nurse was taking her
place as Farley&#8217;s companion for his regular drive
and that they would carry them to the club. This
arrangement caused his breast to swell.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will give my credit a big boost; you&#8217;ll see
a lot of the boys drop dead when we roll up with
Uncle Tim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley alighted to inspect the clubhouse and the
fleet of canoes that bobbed at the landing. It was
a great day for Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something nice about a river,&#8221; said
Nan, as Jerry sent his maroon-colored craft far
out into the stream. &#8220;Ever since I came away I&#8217;ve
missed the old river at Belleville.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was one of the things he liked about Nan.
She referred often to her childhood, and it even
seemed that she spoke of it with a certain wistfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last girl I had out here,&#8221; Jerry said as he
plied his blade, &#8220;was Katie McCarthy, who works
in the County Treasurer&#8217;s office&mdash;mighty responsible
job. I used to know Katie when she stenogged
at four per for a punk lawyer, but I knew she
was better than that, so I pulled a few wires and
got her into the court-house. Katie could be
cashier in a bank&mdash;she&#8217;s that smart! No; not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
much to look at. I studied Katie&#8217;s case a good
deal, and she&#8217;d never make any headway in
offices where they&#8217;d rather have a yellow-haired
girl who overdresses the part and is always slipping
out for a retouch with the chamois. It&#8217;s hard to find
a job for girls like Katie; their only chance is some
place where they&#8217;ve got to have a girl with brains.
These perfumed office darlings, that&#8217;s just got to
go to vaudeville every Monday night so they can
talk about it the rest of the week, never get anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart warms to Katie. I wonder,&#8221; murmured
Nan lazily, as Jerry neatly negotiated a
shallow passage between two sandbars, &#8220;if I had
to do it&mdash;I wonder how much I could earn a
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess you&#8217;d make good all right. You&#8217;ve
got brains and I&#8217;ve never caught you touching up
your complexion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which isn&#8217;t any sign I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve all the necessary articles right here in my
sweater pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, somebody has to use the talcum; we
handle it in carload lots. It&#8217;s one of the Copeland-Farley
specialties I used to brag about easiest when
I bore the weighty sample-case down the line. It
was a good stunt to ask the druggist to introduce
me to some of the girls that&#8217;s always loafing round
the soda-counter in country-town drug stores, and
I&#8217;d hand &#8217;em out a box and ask &#8217;em to try it on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
right there. It cheered up the druggist and the girls
would help me pull a bigger order than I&#8217;d get on
my own hook. A party like that on a sleepy afternoon
in a pill-shop would lift the sky-line considerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you saw me in a drug store wrestling
with a chocolate sundae and had your sample-case
open and were trying to coax an order out of a
druggist, just how would you approach me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; he responded readily. &#8220;I&#8217;d get
your number on the quiet and walk past your house
when your mother was sitting on the porch all alone,
darning socks, and I&#8217;d beg her pardon and say that,
having heard that her daughter was the most beautiful
girl in town, Copeland-Farley had sent me all
the way from the capital to ask her please to accept,
with the house&#8217;s compliments, a gross of our Faultless
Talcum. If mother didn&#8217;t ask me to supper,
it would be a sign that I hadn&#8217;t put it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if father appeared with a shotgun&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d tell him it was the closed season for drummers,
and invite him down to the hotel for a game
of billiards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you always have the answer, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she taunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it; I&#8217;ve got to know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t seen you miss fire yet. My
trouble is,&#8221; she deliberated, touching the water
lightly with her hand, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t have the answer
most of the time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed it sometimes,&#8221; replied Jerry, looking
at her quickly.</p>

<p>It was unseasonably warm, and he drove the
canoe on to a sandy shore in the shade of the
bank. He had confessed to himself that at times,
even in their juvenile badgering, Nan baffled him.
From the beginning of their acquaintance he had
noted abrupt changes of mood that puzzled him.
Occasionally, in the midst of the aimless banter in
which they engaged, she would cease to respond
and a far-away look would come into her violet
eyes. One of these moods was upon her now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember the shanty-boat people down
along the river? I used to think it would be fun to
live like that. I still feel that way sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he answered indulgently, &#8220;I guess everybody
has a spell of that now and then, when you
just want to sort of loaf along, and fish a little when
you&#8217;re hungry, and trust to luck for a handout at
some back door when you&#8217;re too lazy to bait the
hook. That feeling gets hold of me lots of times;
but I shake it off pretty soon. You don&#8217;t get anywhere
loafing; the people that get along have got to
hustle. Cecil says we can&#8217;t just mark time in this
world. We either go ahead or slide back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a slider&mdash;if you can slide without
ever getting up very far!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, drawing in the paddle and
fixing his eyes upon her intently, &#8220;you said something
like that the first night Cecil took me up to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
you, and you&#8217;ve got a touch of it again; but it&#8217;s the
wrong talk. I&#8217;m going to hand it to you straight,
because I guess I&#8217;ve got more nerve than anybody
else you know: you haven&#8217;t got a kick coming, and
you want to cut all that talk. Uncle Tim gets cross
sometimes, but you don&#8217;t want to worry about that
too much. He used to be meaner than fleas at the
store sometimes, but the boys never worried about
it. He&#8217;s all sound inside, and if he riles you the best
thing to do is to forget it. You can&#8217;t please him
all the time, but you can most of the time, and it&#8217;s
up to you to do it. Now, tell me to jump in the
river if you want to, but it was in my system and
I had to get it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know I ought to be grateful; but I&#8217;m
wrong some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Your trouble
is you don&#8217;t have enough to do. You ought to get
interested in something&mdash;something that would
keep you busy and whistling all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>don&#8217;t</i> have enough to do; I know that,&#8221; she
assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to go in good and strong for
something; that&#8217;s the only ticket. Let&#8217;s get out
and climb the bank and walk awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had lost her bearings on the river, but when
they had clambered to the top of the bank she found
that they were near the Kinneys&#8217;. The road was
a much-frequented highway, and she was sorry now
that they had left the canoe; but Jerry, leading the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
way along a rough path that clung close to the river,
continued to philosophize, wholly unconscious of
the neighborhood&#8217;s associations for Nan.</p>

<p>Where the margin between the river and the
road widened they sat on a log while Jerry amplified
his views of life, with discreet applications to
Nan&#8217;s case as he understood it. He was a cheery
and hopeful soul, and in the light of her knowledge
of him she marveled at his clear understanding of
things. He confided to her that he meant to get on;
he wanted to be somebody. She was wholly sympathetic
and told him that he had already done a
great deal; he had done a lot better than she had;
and it counted for more because no one had helped
him.</p>

<p>As they passed the Kinneys&#8217; on their way back
to the canoe, a roadster whizzed out of the gate and
turned toward town. They both recognized Copeland.
As he passed, his eyes fell upon them carelessly;
then he glanced back and slowed down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re in for it!&#8221; said Nan uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m the one that&#8217;s in for it,&#8221; returned
Jerry ruefully.</p>

<p>Copeland left his car at the roadside and walked
rapidly toward them. He nodded affably to Jerry
and extended his hand eagerly to Nan.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is great good luck! Grace is at home; why
didn&#8217;t you come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Amidon is showing me the river; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
just left the canoe to come up for a view from the
bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not come back to Kinneys&#8217;; I want to see
you; and this is a fine chance to have a talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry walked away and began throwing pebbles
into the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. And I can&#8217;t talk to you here.
Papa drove me out and he&#8217;s likely to come back
this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be pretty chummy with that clerk
of mine,&#8221; Copeland remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am; it began about sixteen years ago,&#8221; she
answered, with a laugh. &#8220;We rose from the same
ash-dump.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned, not comprehending. She was about
to turn away when he began speaking rapidly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to hear me, Nan! I haven&#8217;t bothered
you for a long time; you&#8217;ve treated me pretty
shabbily after all there&#8217;s been between us; but you
can square all that now. I&#8217;m in the deepest kind of
trouble. Farley deliberately planned to ruin me and
he&#8217;s about done it! I&#8217;ve paid him off, but I had to
pledge half my stock in the store with the Western
National to raise the money, and now my notes are
due there and they&#8217;re going to pinch me. Eichberg
is a director in the bank and he means to buy in
that stock&mdash;you can see the game. Corbin &amp; Eichberg
are scheming to wipe me out and combine the
two houses. And Farley&#8217;s put them up to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>His face twisted nervously as he talked. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
thinner than when she saw him last, but he bore no
marks of hard living. His story was plausible; Farley
had told her a month ago that he had got his
money out of Copeland, but it hadn&#8217;t occurred to
her that the loan might have been paid with money
borrowed elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you won&#8217;t lose the business, Billy.
It wouldn&#8217;t be square to treat you that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Square! I tell you it was all framed up, and I&#8217;ve
reason to know that Farley stands in with them.
It&#8217;s a fine revenge he&#8217;s taking on me for daring to
love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head and drew further away from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Billy, none of that! That&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it isn&#8217;t over! You know it isn&#8217;t, Nan! I&#8217;ve
missed you; it cut me deep when you dropped me.
You let Farley tell you I was all bad and going to
the dogs and you didn&#8217;t even give me a chance to
defend myself. I tell you I&#8217;ve suffered hell&#8217;s torments
since I saw you last. But now I want you to
tell me you do care. Please, dear&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke plaintively. She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we were good friends, Billy; but you
knew we had to quit. It was wrong all the time&mdash;you
knew that as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what was wrong about it! It can&#8217;t
be wrong for a man to love a woman as I love you!
If you hadn&#8217;t cared, it would be a different story,
but you did, Nan! And you&#8217;re not the girl I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
you to be if you&#8217;ve changed in these few weeks.
I&#8217;ve got a big fight on and I want you to stand by
me. Kinney&#8217;s in all kinds of trouble with the cement
business. If he goes down, I&#8217;m ruined. But even
at that you can help me make a new start. It will
mean everything to have your love and help.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that his appeal had touched her. She was
silent a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do, Billy; I can&#8217;t stand here talking
to you; but I&#8217;m sorry for your troubles. I can&#8217;t
believe you&#8217;re right about papa trying to injure
you; he&#8217;s too fond of the old business for that. But
we were good pals&mdash;you and I. I&#8217;ll try to think
of some way to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her hands roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need you; you know I love you! Farley&#8217;s told
you I want to marry you for his money; but you
can&#8217;t tell anything about him. Very likely he&#8217;ll
cut you out, anyhow; he&#8217;s likely to do that very
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her head and defiance shone for an
instant in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you hear from me within a week; I must
have time&mdash; But keep up your spirits, Billy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The distant honking of a motor caused her to
turn away quickly. Amidon had settled himself
halfway down the bank and she called to him and
began the descent....</p>

<p>If Jerry had expressed his feelings he would have
said that Copeland&#8217;s appearance had given him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
hard jar. It was annoying, just when you have
reached the highest aim of your life, to have your
feet knocked from under you. To have your boss
spoil your afternoon with the prettiest girl in town
was not only disagreeable, but it roused countless
apprehensions.</p>

<p>For the afternoon <i>was</i> spoiled. Nan&#8217;s efforts to
act as though nothing had happened were badly
simulated, and finding that she lapsed frequently
into long reveries, Jerry paddled doggedly back
to the clubhouse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>LAST WILLS AND TESTAMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the beginning of his infirmities Farley&#8217;s
experiments in will-writing had taxed the patience
of Thurston, his lawyer. Within two years he had
made a dozen wills, and he kept them for comparison
in a secret drawer of Mrs. Farley&#8217;s old sewing-table
in his room. He penciled cryptic marks on
the various envelopes for ease of identification,
and he was influenced often by the most trivial
circumstances in his revisions. If Nan irritated him,
he cut down her legacy; when things went happily,
he increased it. He was importuned to make bequests
to great numbers of institutions, by men and
women he knew well, and his attitude toward these
changed frequently. There was hardly a phase of
the laws of descent that Thurston had not explained
to him.</p>

<p>A few days after her river excursion, the colored
man-of-all-work handed Nan an envelope that
had dropped from Farley&#8217;s dressing-gown as it hung
on a clothes-line in the backyard for its periodical
sunning. The envelope was unsealed. In the upper
left-hand corner was the name and address of
Thurston and in the center were four small crosses
in pencil. Nan thrust it into a bureau drawer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
intending to restore it to the dressing-gown pocket
when she could do so without attracting Farley&#8217;s
attention.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell upon it that night as she was preparing
for bed. She laid it on her dressing-table
and studied the queer little crosses as she brushed
her hair.</p>

<p>Copeland had complained of Farley&#8217;s hardness,
and if Billy had told the truth about the plight to
which he had been reduced by Farley&#8217;s refusal to
renew the last notes for the purchase money, the
complaint was just. She crouched on a low stool
before the table and gazed into the reflection of
her eyes.</p>

<p>She played idly with the envelope, resisting an
impulse to open it for a glance at the paper that
crinkled in her fingers. She had been very &#8220;good&#8221;
lately, and to pry into affairs that Farley had sedulously
kept from her was repugnant to her better
nature.... Farley&#8217;s abuse of her on the day of the
luncheon, and his rage over her payment of the
thousand dollars for the defense of her brother
came back to her vividly. He had threatened to
make it impossible for Billy to profit by marrying
her.... She had a right to know what provision
Farley meant to make for her. If in the end he intended
to throw her upon her own resources or to
provide for her in ways that curtailed her liberty,
there was every reason why she should prepare to
meet the situation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The paper slipped from the envelope and she
pressed it open.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I, Timothy Farley, being of sound mind,&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>She had never seen a will before, and the unfamiliar
phraseology fascinated her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... in trust for my daughter, Nancy Corrigan
Farley, for a period of twenty years from my decease,
or until the death of said Nancy Corrigan
Farley, should said death occur prior to the expiration
of said twenty years, the sum of one hundred
thousand dollars. The income from said sum shall
be paid to the said Nancy Corrigan Farley on the
first day of each calendar month....</p>
</div>

<p>Two hundred thousand dollars he gave outright
to the Boys&#8217; Club Association; fifty thousand to the
Children&#8217;s Hospital; and ten thousand each to five
other charitable organizations....</p>

<p>One hundred thousand dollars in trust! An income
of five or six thousand&mdash;less than half the
cost of maintaining the Farley establishment, exclusive
of her personal allowance for clothes! And
this was Farley&#8217;s idea of providing for her. She had
always heard that the act of adoption conferred
all the rights inherent in a child of the blood; it
was inconceivable that Farley would deal in so
miserly a fashion with his own daughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>The will was dated June 17, a week after the
row over Copeland. She had heard that Farley&#8217;s
property approximated a million, and on that basis
she was to pay dearly for that day at the Country
Club!</p>

<p>The trusteeship,&mdash;in itself an insult, an advertisement
of Farley&#8217;s lack of confidence in her,&mdash;was
to continue for what might be all the years of
her life, restricting her freedom, fastening hateful
bonds upon her. In case she married and died
leaving children, the trusteeship was continued
until they attained their majority. A paltry hundred
thousand, and Farley&#8217;s lean hand clutched
even that!</p>

<p>Two hundred thousand for the Boys&#8217; Club&mdash;just
twice what he gave her&mdash;and without restrictions!
The Farleys&#8217; love for her was now reduced
to exact figures. Her foster-father meant to
humiliate her in the eyes of the world by a niggardly
bequest. And he had been protesting his love for
her and permitting her to sacrifice herself for him!</p>

<p>The revelations of the will reinforced Copeland&#8217;s
arraignment of Farley as a harsh and vindictive
man, who drove hard bargains and delighted in
vengeance.</p>

<p>She lay awake for hours, torturing herself into
the belief that she was the most abused of beings.
Then her better nature asserted itself. She reviewed
the generosity and kindness of her foster-parents,
who had given her a place in the world to which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
felt, humbly, that she was not entitled. A hundred
thousand dollars was more money than she had any
right to expect; and the trusteeship was only a part
of Farley&#8217;s kindness&mdash;a device for safeguarding
and protecting her.</p>

<p>Then she flew to the other extreme. He had
brought her up as his own child, encouraging a
belief that she would inherit his whole fortune, and
now he was cutting her off with something like a
tenth and contemptuously bidding her beg for alms
at the door of a trust company!</p>

<p>She stared into the dark until the light crept
through her blinds. Then she slept until the nurse
called her at eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Farley&#8217;s waiting for you to have breakfast
with him; how soon can you be ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he so well?&#8221; Nan asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing unusual; but he seemed tired after his
ride yesterday and had a bad night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan, sitting up in bed, thrust her hand under her
pillow and touched the will guiltily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said, as the nurse crossed to the
windows and threw up the shades, &#8220;that he may
have a relapse at any time. The doctor prepared
me for that. Please order breakfast sent up and
tell papa I&#8217;ll be ready in five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her broodings of the night she had dramatized
herself as confronting him in all manner of situations,
but she was reluctant to face him now. She
jumped out of bed, fortified herself for the day with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
a cold shower, and presented herself to him in a
flowered kimono as the maid was laying the cloth
on the stand by his bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Nan,&#8221; he said wearily, &#8220;I hope you had
a better night than I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need much sleep,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Edison says we all sleep too much, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fool idea. The doctor&#8217;s got to give me
the dope again if I have another such night. I guess
there wasn&#8217;t anything I didn&#8217;t think of. Lyin&#8217;
awake is about as near hell as I care to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The querulousness manifest in the worst period
of his illness had returned. He grumbled at the
nurse&#8217;s arrangement of his pillows and asked for a
tray in bed, saying he didn&#8217;t feel equal to sitting
at the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sit there where I can look at you, Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was aglow from her bath and showed no
trace of her sleepless night. It was pathetically
evident that her presence brought him pleasure
and relief. He had been very happy of late, accepting
fully her assurance that everything was over
between her and Copeland. Her recent social
activities and the fact that some of the &#8220;nice
people&#8221; were showing a renewed interest in her
added to his satisfaction. He bade her talk as he
nibbled his toast and sipped his milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read the newspaper an hour ago clear through
the births and deaths and didn&#8217;t see anything
very cheerful. You been followin&#8217; that Reid will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
case up at Cleveland? I guess you don&#8217;t read the
papers much. You never did; but you ought to
keep posted. Well, that&#8217;s a mighty interestin&#8217; case.
I guess the lawyers are goin&#8217; to get all the money.
I knew old Reid, and he was as sane a man as ever
lived. There ain&#8217;t much use in a man tryin&#8217; to
make a will when they&#8217;re sure to tear it to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan looked at him quickly. It was possible that
he had missed the will and was speaking of wills
in general as a prelude to pouncing upon her with
a question as to whether she had seen it. But he
was not in a belligerent humor. He went on to
explain the legal points involved in the Reid case.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a lot o&#8217; rascally lawyers get hold o&#8217; my property,
I won&#8217;t just turn over in my grave; I&#8217;ll keep
revolvin&#8217;! Reid tried to fix things so his children
wouldn&#8217;t squander his money. His daughters
married fools and he wanted to try and protect
&#8217;em. And just for that they&#8217;ve had the will set
aside on the ground that Reid was crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan acquiesced in his view of this as an outrage.
And she really believed that it was, as Farley spoke
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sometimes wonder whether it ain&#8217;t better just
to let things go,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I been over this
will business with Thurston a thousand times, and
I&#8217;m never sure he knows what he&#8217;s talkin&#8217; about.
Wills made by the best lawyers in the country
seem to break down; there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; sure
about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about that, papa. Mr.
Thurston ought to know about those things if
anybody does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have combated this, as he
combated most emphatic statements; but his willingness
to let it pass unchallenged convinced her
that there had been a sharp change for the worse in
his condition.</p>

<p>It was the way of her contradictory nature to
be moved to pity for him in his weakness, and a
wave of tenderness swept her. After all, if he
wished to cut her off with a hundred thousand
dollars and give the rest to charity he had a right
to do it.</p>

<p>She took the tray from the bed, smoothed the
covers and passed her cool hand over his hot forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, papa,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t bother about
business to-day. Miss Rankin says it&#8217;s only a cold,
but she&#8217;ll have to report it to the doctor. I&#8217;m going
to telephone him to drop in this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He demurred, but not with his usual venomous
tirade against the whole breed of doctors.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Nan,&#8221; he said, clinging to her hand.
&#8220;And I wish you&#8217;d tell Thurston to come in this
afternoon. I want to talk to him about some
matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see the doctor first, papa. We can
have Mr. Thurston in any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knelt impulsively beside the bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;I want you to know, papa, about wills and
things like that, that I don&#8217;t want you to bother
about me. I hope we&#8217;re going to live on together
for long, long years. And anything you mean to do
for me is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly knew herself as she said this. It was
an involuntary utterance; something she could
not have imagined herself saying a few hours earlier
as she lay in bed hating him for his meanness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, I want to do the right thing by you.
It&#8217;s worried me a lot, tryin&#8217; to decide the best way.
I don&#8217;t want to leave any trouble behind me for
you to settle. And I don&#8217;t want to do anything
that&#8217;ll make you think hard o&#8217; me. I want to be
sure you never come to want: that&#8217;s what&#8217;s worried
me. I want you to be happy and comfortable,
little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you do, papa,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
bother about those things now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse came in to take his temperature. Nan
went to her room for the will and, feigning to be
straightening some of the things in his closet, she
thrust the paper into the dressing-gown pocket.</p>

<p>An hour later the Kinney&#8217;s chauffeur left a note
from Grace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Come out this afternoon at any hour you can.
Telephone me where to meet you downtown and
I&#8217;ll bring you out in the car. I needn&#8217;t explain
why, but after Saturday you&#8217;ll understand.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>The doctor found nothing alarming in Farley&#8217;s
condition, but ordered him to remain in bed for a
few days. He said he must have sleep and prescribed
an opiate.</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock Nan left the house.</p>

<small>A KINNEY LARK AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It&#8217;s</span> certainly good to see you again!&#8221; Mrs.
Kinney exclaimed as Nan met her by arrangement
at a confectioner&#8217;s. &#8220;How much time are you
going to give me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t any,&#8221; laughed Nan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve run
away. Papa isn&#8217;t so well to-day and couldn&#8217;t take
his drive as usual, so I&#8217;m truanting&mdash;and very
naughty. I must be back in the house before five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when I got your message I telephoned
Billy to come to the house and he&#8217;ll be there as
soon as we are. He&#8217;s been in the depths for weeks.
You know you had got a mighty strong hold on
dear old Billy, and when you dropped him it hurt.
And we&#8217;ve all missed you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kinneys and their friends had missed her;
they had missed her dash, her antics&mdash;the Nan she
had resolved to be no more. But it was pleasant
to be in Mrs. Kinney&#8217;s company again. She was a
simple, friendly soul who liked clothes and a good
time; her capacity for enjoying anything serious
was wholly negligible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew, of course, that Billy was back of your
invitation. I saw him Saturday&mdash;quite accidentally,
and he was bluer than indigo.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;He spent Sunday with us and told us all about
meeting you. He was perfectly furious because you
were out skylarking with one of his clerks! But he
got to laughing about it,&mdash;told us some funny
stories about your new suitor,&mdash;Jerry, is that the
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Jeremiah Amidon, please,&#8221; laughed Nan.
&#8220;It was killing that Billy should find me out canoeing
with him. Jerry and I were kids together, and
he&#8217;s grown to be a great consolation to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be a consolation to Billy, too; he says
the youngster&#8217;s trying to reform him!&#8221; Grace
suddenly clasped Nan&#8217;s hand. &#8220;You ought to take
charge of Billy! He&#8217;s awfully in love with you,
Nan. He&#8217;s going to urge you to marry him&mdash;at
once. That&#8217;s why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! I&#8217;ll never do it,&#8221; cried Nan despairingly.</p>

<p>It was another of her mistakes, this yielding to
Copeland&#8217;s demand for an interview that could
have but one purpose. She was thoroughly angry
at herself, half angry at Mrs. Kinney for acting as
Copeland&#8217;s intermediary.</p>

<p>Copeland was pacing the veranda smoking a
cigarette when they reached the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty nice of you to come, Nan,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard, Billy, that the haughty John Eaton&#8217;s
rather attentive to the late Mrs. Copeland,&#8221; said
Grace, when they had gathered about the tea-table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
&#8220;She was among those present at a little
dinner he gave at the University Club the other
night in honor of that English novelist who&#8217;s visiting
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re bitter because he left you out,&#8221; said
Copeland indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my bitterness won&#8217;t hurt Fanny. I suppose
you&#8217;ve heard that she&#8217;s come into a nice bunch of
money&mdash;something like a quarter of a million!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland&#8217;s surprise was evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like a fairy story; but I hope it&#8217;s
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Nan quietly. &#8220;Mrs.
Copeland told me herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kinney had risen to leave them and Copeland
had crossed the room to open the door for her.
They were arrested by Nan&#8217;s surprising confirmation
of this report that Mrs. Copeland had come
into an unexpected inheritance. Nan vouchsafed
nothing more; and at a glance from Copeland Grace
left them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you and Fanny were seeing each
other these days,&#8221; he remarked as he sat down beside
her. &#8220;Something new, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, papa always admired her and he took me
out to see her a little while ago, and then that day
you saw her with us at the bank he insisted on taking
her home for luncheon. She told us then about
the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland smiled grimly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;Of course, you know what it means&mdash;Farley&#8217;s
sudden affection for Fanny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he used to see a good deal of her, didn&#8217;t
he, when you were first married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Farley and Fanny exchanged a few calls
and we were there for dinner once, while you were
still away at school. But this is different; he&#8217;s
throwing you with her for a purpose, as you ought
to see. It does credit to the old man&#8217;s cunning. He
thinks that if you become good friends with Fanny,
he can be sure you&#8217;ve dropped me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish! Papa has always liked her; he likes
the kind of woman who can run a farm and make
money out of it; he thinks she&#8217;s a good example
for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him fool you about that!&#8221; he said
petulantly. &#8220;He&#8217;s an old Shylock and he&#8217;s about
taken the last ounce out of me. Paying him that
last twenty-five thousand has put me in a bad hole.
And it&#8217;s pure vengeance. If he wasn&#8217;t afraid you
were going to marry me, he would never have driven
me so hard. He thinks if he can ruin me financially
you&#8217;ll quit me for good. It was understood when
I bought him out that he&#8217;d be easy about the payments.
There&#8217;s a frame-up between him and Corbin
&amp; Eichberg to force me out of business. And
he&#8217;s been calling some of the old employees up
to see him, and encouraging Amidon to trot up
there so he can worm things out of him. I don&#8217;t
think he gets anything out of Jerry,&#8221; he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
taking warning of a resentful gleam in Nan&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;I think the boy&#8217;s loyal to me; in fact&#8221;&mdash;he
grinned ruefully&mdash;&#8220;he&#8217;s full of an ambition to
make a man of me! But you must see that it&#8217;s all
a game to draw you away from me. Farley&#8217;s not
the sort of man to waste time on a youngster like
Amidon for nothing, and this throwing you in
Fanny&#8217;s way is about as smooth a piece of work as
I ever knew him to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating, Billy; and as far as Jerry
is concerned, papa likes him; he always takes an
interest in poor boys. And the fact that Jerry
came from down there on the river where he had
his own early struggles probably makes him a little
more sympathetic with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old gentleman&#8217;s sympathies,&#8221; said Copeland,
bending forward and meeting her gaze with
a significant look, &#8220;are likely to cost you a whole
lot of money, Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just how do you make that out, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the hospitals and charitable concerns in
town have been working on Farley to do something
for them in his will, and I heard yesterday that he&#8217;s
promised to do something big for the Boys&#8217; Club
people. You&#8217;ve probably seen Trumbull at the
house a good deal&mdash;he&#8217;s the kind of fellow who&#8217;d
make an impression on Farley. I got this from
Kinney. He gave them some money last year and
they put him on the board of directors. They&#8217;re
all counting on something handsome from the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
man. I assume he hasn&#8217;t told you anything
about it; it wouldn&#8217;t be like him to! He means
to die and let you find out just what his affection
for you comes down to in dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he has a right to do what he likes with
his money,&#8221; Nan replied slowly, repeating the
phrase with which she had sought to console herself
since the will fell into her hands. &#8220;I suppose
he thinks he&#8217;s done enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The phrases of the will danced before her eyes:
Copeland&#8217;s intimations squared with the facts as
she knew them to be; she had seen tangible proof
of their accuracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to admit that he&#8217;s been kind to you,
but he hasn&#8217;t any right to bring you up as his
daughter and then cut you off. You stand in law as
his own child, and if he should die without making
a will, you&#8217;d inherit everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the law hasn&#8217;t made me his own child,&#8221;
said Nan bitterly.</p>

<p>Seeing her resentment, and feeling that he was
gaining ground, he proceeded cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s likely to have a sudden call one
of these days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; or he may live several years, so the doctor
told me. But I don&#8217;t want to think of that. And I
don&#8217;t like to think of what he may do or not do for
me,&#8221; she added earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t!&#8221; he assented. &#8220;But he
hasn&#8217;t any right to stand between you and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
happiness. If he had the right feeling about you,
he&#8217;d want to see you married and settled before he
dies. I suppose he&#8217;s never told you what he meant
to do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But he&#8217;s told me what he wouldn&#8217;t do
if I married you; he laid that down in the plainest
English!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it; but no man has a right to do
any such thing. Just why he hates me so I don&#8217;t
understand. It oughtn&#8217;t to be a crime to love
you, Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand touched hers, then clasped it tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we should be talking of these
things at all,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I love you; and I believe
that deep down in your heart you love me.
You&#8217;re not going to say you don&#8217;t, Nan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ve always liked you a lot, Billy,&#8221;
she answered evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before Farley got the idea that I wanted to
marry you for his money and abused me and made
you unhappy, you cared; you can&#8217;t deny that. And
I don&#8217;t believe his hatred of me really made any
difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the wiser course not to abuse Farley. He
felt that he was winning her to a yielding mood,
and his hopes rose.</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand suddenly and bent her
eyes upon him with disconcerting intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me, Billy, the real truth about your
trouble with Fanny?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The abruptness of her question startled him. The
color deepened in his face and he blinked under her
searching gaze. She had never before spoken of
his trouble with his former wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said rallying quickly, &#8220;is all over
and done. It hasn&#8217;t anything to do with you
and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy; I think it has! If you&#8217;re really
serious in wanting to marry me, I think I ought
to know about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you could doubt my seriousness;
you&#8217;ve been the one serious thing in my whole life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Fanny&mdash;&#8221; she persisted, gently touching
his hands that were loosely clasped on his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the trouble was that we were never suited
to each other. She&#8217;s quiet, domestic&mdash;a country-town
girl, and never fitted into things here. She
wanted to sit at home every evening and sew and
expected me to wait around for her to drop a spool
so I could get excitement out of scrambling for it.
And she didn&#8217;t like my friends, or doing the things
I like. Her idea of having a gay time was to go to
the state fair once a year and look at live stock!
I think she hated me toward the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that other story about her&mdash;about another
man; she doesn&#8217;t look like that sort of
woman, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t in the case at all. The divorce
was given for incompatibility. Whatever else there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
may have been didn&#8217;t figure. I made it as easy for
her as possible, of course. And I&#8217;ve no doubt she
was as glad to quit as I was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t think&mdash;you didn&#8217;t honestly
believe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought she was interested in Manning;
and we had some trouble about that. He used to
come here a good deal. He was an old friend of
mine and his business brought him to town pretty
often for a couple of years. He&#8217;s a fellow of quiet
tastes&mdash;just her sort&mdash;and I hoped when I got
out of the way she&#8217;d marry him. I want you to be
satisfied about everything, Nan. I tell you everything&#8217;s
over between Fanny and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and took a turn across the room, paused
at the window, glanced out upon the lawn and the
strip of woodland beyond. He became impatient
as the minutes passed. Then she faced him suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Billy,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He was eagerly protesting when Mrs. Kinney
appeared at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you two looking so glum about? You
need cheering up and I&#8217;ve got a fine surprise for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; said Nan, relieved at the interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, you&#8217;re not! Bob has just telephoned
that the Burleys of Chicago are in town and
they&#8217;re coming out for dinner. And I&#8217;ve telephoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the Liggetts and the Martins and George Pickard
and Edith Saxby and the Andrews. It will be like
old times to have the old crowd together once
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Nan will stay! She&#8217;s been making
me miserable lately and that will help her square
herself,&#8221; said Copeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go, really,&#8221; Nan reiterated, suspecting
that the party had been arranged in advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Copeland. &#8220;You can telephone
home that you&#8217;ve been delayed&mdash;you can
arrange it someway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I went downtown on an errand! I don&#8217;t
see it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner&#8217;s at six; the Burleys have to go into
town early,&#8221; said Mrs. Kinney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let her go!&#8221; exclaimed Copeland. &#8220;Our
Nan isn&#8217;t the good sport she used to be, and she
doesn&#8217;t love any of us any more. She&#8217;s gone back
on all her old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, she hasn&#8217;t. I never knew her to take
a dare! I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s going to do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan surveyed them defiantly and looked at her
watch.</p>

<p>She felt that she had finally dismissed Billy, and
her last word to him had left her elated. It might
be worth while to wait, at any hazard, to ease his
discomfiture, and to show the Kinneys and their
friends that she had not cut them; and, moreover,
she was unwilling to have them know how greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
her old freedom was curtailed. The time had passed
quickly and she could not reach home before seven
even if she left immediately. Miss Rankin had
covered up her absences before and might do so
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me telephone and I&#8217;ll see how things are
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse&#8217;s report was reassuring. Farley, who
had rested badly for several nights, was sleeping.
He might not waken for an hour&mdash;perhaps not for
several hours. Miss Rankin volunteered to explain
Nan&#8217;s absence if he should call for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Grace, you may a lay a plate for me!&#8221;
she announced cheerfully. &#8220;But I must be on my
way right after dinner. You understand that!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see you on the good old cocktail
route again, Nan!&#8221; declared Pickard. &#8220;We heard
you&#8217;d taken the veil!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cocktails were passed before they went to the
table; there were quarts for everybody, Grace assured
them. The men had already fortified themselves
downtown against any lack of an appetizer
at the house. Mocking exclamations of surprise
and alarm followed Nan&#8217;s rejection of her glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair, Nan!&#8221; they chorused, gathering
about her. &#8220;You used to swallow six without
blinking an eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s joined the crape-hangers for sure! I
didn&#8217;t think it of our Nan!&#8221; mourned Pickard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;Oh, anything to stop your crying!&#8221; Nan took
the glass Kinney had been holding for her. &#8220;There!
I hope you&#8217;re satisfied. It&#8217;s silly to make so much
fuss about a mere cocktail. No, thanks; not another!
There&#8217;s no point in taking the same dare
twice!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the table the talk at once became animated.
Nan had been away from them so long that she had
half forgotten their range of interests. Burley&#8217;s
expensive new machine, in which he had motored
down from Chicago; &#8220;shows&#8221; they had seen; a
business scheme&mdash;biggest thing afoot, Burley
threw in parenthetically, with a promise to tell
Kinney more about it later; George Pickard&#8217;s attentions
to the soubrette in a musical comedy, and
references to flirtations which the married men
present had been engaging in&mdash;these things were
flung upon the table to be pecked at and dismissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You people are the only real sports in this dismal
swamp of a town! I don&#8217;t know how you live
here among so many dead ones!&#8221; said Burley.</p>

<p>Kinney declared that he intended to move to
New York as soon as he got rid of his patent suits;
he was tired of living in a one-horse town. This
suggested a discussion of the merits of New York
hotels&mdash;a subject which the Kinneys everywhere
west of Manhattan Island find endlessly exciting.</p>

<p>When champagne was served, Burley rose with
elaborate dignity and invited the other men to join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
in a toast to the ladies; they were the best girls in
America; he defied anybody to gainsay him. He
wished they might all travel about together all the
time hitting only the high places; and he extended
a general invitation to the company to meet him at
Palm Beach the next winter for what he promised
should be a grand time.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d make it Japan if he&#8217;d only had a few more
drinks,&#8221; his wife remarked to Nan.</p>

<p>By the time salad was served George Pickard
thought it well to justify his reputation as a &#8220;cut-up.&#8221;
His father, a successful lawyer, had left him
a comfortable fortune which George was rapidly
distributing. George had rebelled against the
tame social life of the town in which he was born;
he was bored by respectability, and found the freedom
of the Kinneys&#8217; establishment wholly to his
liking. He went to the living-room for the victrola
and wheeled it in, playing the newest tango, to a
point just behind Nan&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to have music; got the habit and can&#8217;t eat
without music!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was accepted as a joke until Copeland protested
that he couldn&#8217;t stand the noise and began
struggling with Pickard, who bitterly resented his
effort to push the machine out of the room. The
music was hushed presently and Pickard resumed
his seat with the understanding that he might play
all he pleased after dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have a dance&mdash;I haven&#8217;t danced a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
step in ages!&#8221; cried Nan, entering into the spirit of
the occasion.</p>

<p>She had always excused their vulgarity on the
ground that they were at least cheerful, and that
probably they were just as good as the people
who frowned upon them. Their admiration was evident
from the frequency with which they invited
her opinion on the questions under discussion;
and it was a relief to escape from the invalid air of
home and from what she had convinced herself was
Farley&#8217;s hostility.</p>

<p>Several times her fingers touched the stem of her
wineglass, only to be withdrawn quickly. Copeland,
sitting beside her, noticed her indecision and
drew the glass toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one, for old times&#8217; sake, Nan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Billy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She emptied her glass, and then, turning to Copeland,
laid her fingers lightly across the rim.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all; not another drop!&#8221; she said in a low
tone.</p>

<p>He laughed and held up his glass for inspection;
he had barely touched his lips to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had only one cocktail and I haven&#8217;t taken any
of this stuff,&#8221; he said with a glance that invited
approval. &#8220;I can do it; you see I can do it! I can
do anything for you, Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>The furtive touch of his hand seemed to establish
an understanding between them that they were
spectators, not participants in the revel.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">THE FURTIVE TOUCH OF HIS HAND SEEMED TO ESTABLISH AN UNDERSTANDING<br />
BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY WERE SPECTATORS, NOT PARTICIPANTS<br />
IN THE REVEL</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;I know you can, and you must, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise and confusion increased. Edith Saxby
had begun to cry&mdash;Nan remembered that Edith
usually cried when she was tipsy. She was bewailing
the loss of her salted almonds which she charged
Andrews with appropriating. Andrews thereupon
went to the sideboard and brought the serving-dish
of almonds and poured the contents upon the
girl&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Pickard leaned across the table to wipe away
her tears with his napkin. In attempting this feat
he upset the wine-glasses of his immediate neighbors,
causing a wild scamper to escape the resulting
deluge. Liggett and Burley retaliated by pushing
him upon the table, where he crowned himself with
the floral centerpiece. Boisterous expressions of
delight greeted this masterstroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is getting too rotten!&#8221; shouted Copeland.</p>

<p>He seized Pickard and dragged him from the table
amid general protests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Biggest joke of all,&#8221; cried Kinney, pointing at
Copeland, &#8220;that Billy&#8217;s sober. Everybody else
drunk, but Billy sober&#8217;s a judge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Liggett, a stout blonde, shrilly resenting this
as an imputation upon her character, attempted
to retaliate by slapping Kinney, who began running
round the table to escape her. This continued with
the others cheering them on until she tripped and
fell headlong amid screams of consternation from
the women and roars of delight from the men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;This is what I call a real ball!&#8221; declared Burley.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Liggett had been carried to a divan
in the hall to recuperate, they decided that the
possibilities of the table had been exhausted and
returned to the living-room where the victrola was
again set going.</p>

<p>Nan, lingering in the hall, found Andrews beside
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always meant to tell you I loved you, Nan;
now&#8217;s a good time,&#8221; he blurted. &#8220;No girl like you,
Nancy!&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife appeared suddenly at the door and
screamed at him to behave himself, while the others
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rules all suspended to-night; nobody going to
be jealous!&#8221; cried Burley encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to kiss me, Nan,&#8221; Andrews resumed; &#8220;kiss
everybody else but you never&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She pushed him away in disgust. Kinney entertainments,
viewed soberly, clearly lacked the zest
she had found in them when exhilarated. She
looked at her watch. She must leave immediately.
Copeland beckoned to her and she turned to him
with relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s half-past eight, Nan; how soon must you
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once; I shouldn&#8217;t have stayed in the first
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be glad enough to shake this bunch!
Get your things and I&#8217;ll go for the car.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>He had been a very different Billy to-night. It
was clear that he meant to be kind and considerate.
The butler passed them bearing a jingling tray to
answer a demand for high-balls from the living-room.
Billy was the only sober man in the company,
and she gave him full credit for his abstemiousness.
They were calling her insistently to come
and do some of the &#8220;stunts&#8221; that she had always
contributed to their parties.</p>

<p>She walked to the open door and laughed at them
mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all in, dead tired! Billy&#8217;s going to take
me home!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of them, flushed, rumpled, maudlin,
increased her desire to escape as quickly as possible.
She bade them good-night amid their loud
reproaches, went for her hat and coat, and was
soon in Copeland&#8217;s white roadster spinning toward
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Nan, this is fine. We can go on with our
talk now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we finished that, Billy. We can&#8217;t go back
to it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we can; there&#8217;s only one way to end
it! That sort of thing&#8221;&mdash;he jerked his head toward
the Kinneys&#8217;&mdash;&#8220;isn&#8217;t for you and me. I&#8217;ve cut
it out; passed it up for good. I&#8217;m going to live
straight and try to get back all I&#8217;ve lost: I know
everybody&#8217;s down on me&mdash;waiting to see me
take the count. But with you everything will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
different. You know that; you understand it,
Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan&#8217;s thoughts were sober ones. She did like
Billy; his good conduct at the party was encouraging;
he could be a man if he would. He was a boy&mdash;a
big, foolish boy, kind of heart, and generous,
with a substratum of real character. The actual
difference in years did not matter greatly; he was
as slim and trim as a youngster just out of college.
From the beginning of their acquaintance they had
got on amazingly well together. And he loved her;
she was honestly convinced of this. Like many young
girls she had found the adoration of an older man
flattering. A Farley had been cruelly unjust to
her; there was always that justification. Even after
she had given him her solemn assurances that she
would not marry Billy, he had deliberately planned
to give the bulk of his fortune to charity.</p>

<p>After the scenes at the Kinneys&#8217; she found infinite
relief and comfort in the rush of the cool
night air, and in the bright shield of stars above.
Billy was the only person in all the world who
cared, who understood! In her anxiety to be just,
she gave to his good conduct during the evening an
exaggerated importance and assured herself that
there was a manliness in him that she had never
appreciated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Billy!&#8221; she said softly, and laid her
hand lightly on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>With a happy laugh he brought the machine to
an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little girl! Dear little Nan!&#8221; he murmured,
his arms clasping her. &#8220;You belong to me
now; nobody&#8217;s ever going to take you away from
me. I love you; you&#8217;re dearer to me than all the
world; and I&#8217;m so happy and proud!&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked for a time in subdued tones of the
future. Yes; she had made the great decision. It
seemed, now that she had given her word, that it
had been inevitable from the beginning. There
would be no more uncertainty, no more unhappiness.
His arms were a happy refuge. No one had
ever been as kind to her as he had been. She no
longer questioned his good faith, or doubted his
love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, we must hurry! I&#8217;m in for a bad
time, if I&#8217;m caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she reached the house the nurse let her
in. Farley had wakened once and asked for her,
Miss Rankin said, but he had been satisfied with
an explanation that Nan had gone early to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>BILLS PAYABLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> six o&#8217;clock every morning Mr. Jeremiah Amidon&#8217;s
alarm-clock sent him trotting down the hall
of his boarding-house to the bathroom for an immersion
in cold water. When he had carefully
dressed himself, he pulled weights for ten minutes,
and thus refreshed and strengthened was able to
wring a smile from the saddest boarder at the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>He now opened the office mail. No one knew
who had conferred this responsibility upon him;
all that any one knew about the matter was that
Jerry got down first and had the job done usually
by eight o&#8217;clock. He did it well; there was no denying
that. It was the only way, he told Copeland,
that you could keep track of the business. He assumed
also the task of replying to complaints of
protesting customers, and carried the replies to
Copeland to sign. The errors, omissions, and delays
complained of became, under Jerry&#8217;s hand, a matter
of chagrin and personal grief to the head of the
house. These literary performances were in a key
of cheerful raillery, made possible by his knowledge
of the domestic affairs or social habits of the kicking
customer. Where there was real ground for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
complaint and the patron was a valued one, Jerry
telegraphed an apology. Copeland demurred at
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if that fellow does get a damaged shipment
occasionally?&#8221; said Copeland, frowning over
one of these messages; &#8220;he&#8217;s one of the slowest
customers on our list. It wouldn&#8217;t be any great
calamity if we lost him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s slow all right,&#8221; Jerry admitted, &#8220;but he&#8217;s
dead sure; and he has an old uncle who owns about
a section of the fattest bottom land on the Wabash.
When the old gent dies, Sam&#8217;s going to put up a
building for himself and build a drug store that
will be more beautiful than Solomon in full evening
dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These old uncles never die,&#8221; observed Copeland
dryly, handing back the telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;s will. He&#8217;s mostly paralyzed now and it
won&#8217;t be long till we get an order for a new stock.
Sam was in town last week and talked over the
fittings for his new store. You&#8217;ll find seven dollars
in my expense account that covers victuals and
drink I threw into Samuel; but I paid for the tickets
to the Creole Queens Burlesque out of my own pocket
so&#8217;s to bring down my average.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; let &#8217;er go,&#8221; laughed Copeland.</p>

<p>No one else in the establishment ever joked with
Copeland. His father had been a melancholy dyspeptic;
and the tradition of Farley&#8217;s bad temper
and profanity still caused the old employees to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
walk softly. Copeland found Jerry&#8217;s freshness and
cheek diverting. Jerry, by imperceptible degrees,
was infusing snap into the organization. And Copeland
knew that the house needed snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;About telegrams: I guess we do more telegraphing
than any house on the street!&#8221; Jerry informed
him. &#8220;You can send a jolly by lightning anywhere
in Indiana for a quarter; and nothing tickles one of
these country fellows like getting a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to consider the dignity of the house
just a little bit; try to remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our game,&#8221; replied Jerry confidently, &#8220;is to
hold the business we&#8217;ve got and get more. The old
system&#8217;s played out. This isn&#8217;t the only house that
feels it,&#8221; he added consolingly. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s got
to rustle these days. We&#8217;re conservative, of course,
and deliver the goods straight every time, but we
must keep shooting pep into the organization.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry had gone to the private office with one of
his sugar letters, as he called his propitiatory masterpieces,
on the day after Copeland&#8217;s meeting with
Nan at the Kinneys&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Jerry,&#8221; said Copeland, as Amidon
turned to go, &#8220;what&#8217;s this joke you&#8217;ve put over in
the Bigger Business Club? I didn&#8217;t tell anybody
I wanted to be president. I was never in the club-rooms
but once and that was to look at that billiard
table I gave the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry ran his finger round the inside of his collar
and blinked innocently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;It was just an uprising of the people, Mr. Copeland.
The boys had to have you. You got two
hundred votes, and Sears, of the Thornwood Furniture
Company, was the next man with only sixty-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did that, you young scoundrel,&#8221; said Copeland
good humoredly, &#8220;and I suppose you gave
&#8216;The News&#8217; my picture to print in their account of
the hotly contested election!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; I only told the reporter where I thought
he would find one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bigger Business Club was an organization
of clerks and traveling men, that offered luncheon
and billiards and trade journals in a suite of rooms
in the Board of Trade Building. It took itself very
seriously, and was highly resolved to exercise its
best endeavors in widening the city&#8217;s markets. Incidentally
the luncheon served at thirty cents was
the cheapest in town, and every other Saturday night
during the winter there was a smoker where such
subjects as &#8220;Selling Propositions,&#8221; &#8220;The Square
Deal&#8221; and &#8220;Efficiency&#8221; were debated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that you&#8217;ve wished it on me, what
am I going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your election scores one for the house and, of
course, you&#8217;re going to take the job. The directors
meet once a month, and you&#8217;ll have to attend some
of the meetings; and you ought to turn out at a few
of the smokers, anyhow. It will help the boys a lot
to have you show an interest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Copeland&#8217;s face became serious. He swung round
in his chair and stared at the wall for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I might do those young fellows some
good, do you?&#8221; he demanded bitterly. &#8220;Well, you
seem to have a better opinion of me than most
people. I&#8217;m much obliged to you, Jerry. If you&#8217;re
going up there for lunch to-day I&#8217;ll go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland had ceased to be amused by Jerry&#8217;s
personal devotion; there was something the least
bit pathetic in it. If any one else had taken the
trouble to make him president of a club of clerks
and drummers he would have scorned it,&mdash;but
no one else would have taken the trouble! He was
satisfied of that.</p>

<p>Copeland was at last thoroughly sobered by his
financial situation. For two years the drug business
had been losing steadily. Farley&#8217;s strong hand was
missed; in spite of his animosity toward Farley,
Copeland realized that his father&#8217;s old partner had
been the real genius of the business.</p>

<p>His original subscription of fifty thousand dollars
for Kinney&#8217;s cement stock had been increased from
time to time in response to the importunities of the
sanguine and pushing Kinney until he now had
three hundred thousand dollars invested. The bank
had declined to accept his cement stock as collateral
for the loan he was obliged to ask to take up Farley&#8217;s
notes and had insisted that he put up Copeland-Farley
stock, a demand with which he had
reluctantly complied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>One hundred thousand dollars of paper in the
Western National matured on the 1st of November,
only five days distant. Copeland was pondering a
formidable list of maturing obligations that afternoon
when Eaton appeared at the door of his private
office. Copeland had never had any business
with Eaton. Though Eaton was defending Kinney&#8217;s
patents, Copeland had never attended any of their
conferences and the lawyer&#8217;s attenuated figure
and serious countenance gave him a distinct shock.</p>

<p>It was possible, if not likely, that Farley had got
wind of Nan&#8217;s interview with him and had sent the
lawyer with a warning that Nan must be let alone.
Eaton would be a likely choice for such an errand&mdash;likelier
than Thurston. Copeland had always
found Eaton&#8217;s gravity disconcerting; and to-day
the lawyer seemed unusually sedate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope I haven&#8217;t chosen an unfortunate hour
for my visit? I don&#8217;t have much business down this
way and I&#8217;m never sure when you men on the street
are busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you at any time,&#8221; Copeland replied
with a cordiality he did not feel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t seem to meet very often,&#8221; remarked
Eaton. &#8220;I used to see you at the University Club
in old times, but you&#8217;ve been cutting us out lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get there very often. The Hamilton is
nearer the store and it&#8217;s a little more convenient
place to meet anybody you want to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to quit the University myself if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the members don&#8217;t stop napping in the library after
luncheon,&#8221; remarked Eaton musingly. &#8220;Rather a
dim room, you remember? Only a few afternoons
ago a fellow was sprawled out on a divan sleeping
sweetly and I sat down on him&mdash;very annoying.
The idea of gorging yourself so in the middle of the
day that you&#8217;ve got to sleep it off is depressing. I
suppose we can be undisturbed here for a few minutes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;re all right here,&#8221; Copeland assented
with misgivings. He thrust the list of accounts payable
into a drawer, and waited for Eaton to unfold
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come on a delicate matter, Copeland; business
that is rather out of my line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d come to tell me we&#8217;d got a decision
in the cement case. It would cheer us a good
deal to know that Kinney&#8217;s patents have been sustained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we haven&#8217;t got a decision yet. But
I&#8217;m reasonably sure of success there. If I hadn&#8217;t
had faith in Kinney&#8217;s patents I shouldn&#8217;t have
undertaken to defend them. We ought to have a
decision now very shortly; any day, in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Kinney isn&#8217;t worrying; he&#8217;s been going
ahead just as though his rights were founded on
rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they are. It might have been better
policy not to extend the business until we had
clearance papers from the highest court, but Kinney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
thought he ought to push on while the going&#8217;s good.
He&#8217;s an ambitious fellow, and the stuff he makes
is in demand; but you know more about that than
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be frank about it, I&#8217;d be glad to clear out
of it,&#8221; said Copeland. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t desert him
while his patents are in question&mdash;the stock&#8217;s
unsalable now, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when we might have compromised
those suits on fairly good terms; but I
advised Kinney against it. The responsibility of
making the fight is mine. And,&#8221; Eaton added with
one of his rare smiles, &#8220;I shall owe you all an
apology if I get whipped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland shrugged his shoulders. His uncertainty
as to the nature of Eaton&#8217;s errand caused him to
fidget nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said before,&#8221; Eaton resumed, &#8220;my purpose
in coming to see you is wholly out of my line. In
fact, I shan&#8217;t be surprised if you call it sheer impudence;
but I wish to assure you that I come in the
best spirit in the world. I hope you will understand
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland was confident now that Eaton brought
some message from Farley. There was no other
imaginable explanation of the visit. He was thinking
hard, and to gain time he opened his top drawer
and extended a box of cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said Eaton, staring absently at
the cigars. &#8220;To repeat, Copeland, my errand isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
an agreeable one, and I apologize for my presumption
in undertaking it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland chose a cigar carefully and slammed the
drawer on the box. Perhaps Farley had chosen
Eaton as a proper person to marry Nan; she liked
him; Eaton had always had an unaccountable fascination
for women. He became impatient for the
lawyer to continue; but Eaton had never been more
maddeningly deliberate.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I assume, for a moment, Copeland, that
you have obligations outstanding that cause you,
we will say, temporary embarrassment? Just a moment,
please!&#8221; Copeland had moved forward suddenly
in his chair with resentment burning hot in
his face. &#8220;The assumption may be unwarranted,&#8221;
Eaton continued; &#8220;if so, I apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland thrust his cigar into his mouth and
bit it savagely. Farley had undoubtedly taken
over the maturing notes at the Western National
and had sent Eaton to taunt him with the change
of ownership. Eaton removed his eyeglasses and
polished them with the whitest of handkerchiefs.
His eyes, unobscured by the thick lenses, told
Copeland nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may have misled you into thinking that my
errand is purely social. I shall touch upon business;
but I am not personally concerned in it in any way
whatever. You might naturally conclude that I
represent some corporation, bank, or trust company.
I assure you that I do not. It may occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
to you that Mr. Farley sent me, but he has not
mentioned you to me in this, or in any other connection
remotely bearing upon my errand. You
may possibly suspect that some one near you&mdash;some
one in your office, for example&mdash;has been
telling tales out of school. I will say explicitly that
young Amidon, while a friend of mine, and a boy
I particularly like, has given me no hint&mdash;not even
the remotest idea&mdash;of any such state of things. I
hope you are satisfied on those points?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many persons at different times in John Cecil
Eaton&#8217;s life, enraged by his cool, unruffled demeanor,
had been moved to tell him to go to the devil; but
no one had ever done so. Copeland did not do so
now, though he was strongly impelled to violent
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go the length of saying that you are in
considerable danger right now,&#8221; Eaton went on as
Copeland continued to watch him impassively.
&#8220;If the Western National should foreclose on your
stock, you would be pretty nearly wiped out of this
old concern, that was founded and conducted for
years by your father and is still identified with his
name. I am in a position to pay those notes and
carry them&mdash;carry renewals until you can take
them up. I will say frankly that I don&#8217;t consider
them a good investment, and I have said so to the
person I represent; but to repeat again, I am not
here as a lawyer or business man. My purpose is
wholly friendly, and quite disinterested. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
merely go to the bank and take up the notes&mdash;thus
destroying the hopes of certain gentlemen&mdash;your
competitors in business&mdash;who entertain the
cheerful idea of buying in your stock and putting
you out of business. That would be a calamity&mdash;for
you; and it would be deplorable to have an
old house like Copeland-Farley lose its identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland was still silent. He had caught at one
motive for this visit after another, but Eaton had
disposed of all of them. Eaton&#8217;s reputation as a
man of strict&mdash;of rather quixotic&mdash;honor did not
encourage the belief that he would deliberately lie.
But there was a trap concealed somewhere, Copeland
reflected; he resolved not to be caught. If he
effected an immediate marriage with Nan, Farley
would, he believed, do something handsome for
her. He would storm and bluster in his usual way;
but he would hardly dare go the length of cutting
her off entirely. It was conceivable that he might
advance money to save Copeland-Farley from
catastrophe. There was a vein of sentiment in
Timothy Farley; brought face to face with the idea
of having the business he had done so much to
establish eliminated, it was wholly possible that he
would come down handsomely if Nan were introduced
into the situation as a factor.</p>

<p>Copeland was irritated by Eaton&#8217;s cocksure
manner&mdash;a manner well calculated to cause irritation.
Men did not make such offers from purely
philanthropic motives. Eaton, moreover, was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
friend of his; they hardly spoke the same language.
Nan, he still suspected, was somehow the
object and aim of these overtures. His mind
worked quickly. He meant to marry Nan at once,
within a few days if his plans succeeded, and
he was not to be frustrated by any scheme for
placing himself at the mercy of a new and concealed
creditor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to you, Eaton,&#8221; he answered
steadily; &#8220;but I&#8217;m not quite all in yet. I can&#8217;t
imagine where you got that idea. If I didn&#8217;t
know you were a gentleman I should be pretty
hot. Things have been a little tight with me, I
confess; but that&#8217;s largely due to cutting down my
capital in the drug business to back up what I had
invested with Kinney. I&#8217;m working out satisfactorily
and don&#8217;t need help; but I&#8217;m obliged to you
just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton nodded reflectively; his face betrayed no
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be possible, of course, for me to buy
those maturing notes without your knowledge or
consent. But I thought it would look better&mdash;help
your credit, in other words&mdash;if you took them
up yourself. You can see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland had already thought of this; the idea
did not add to his comfort. The mystery that enveloped
Eaton enraged him; business was not done
in this way. If anybody wanted to put one hundred
thousand dollars into the drug house, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
direct businesslike ways of suggesting it. He
tipped himself back in his chair and pointed the
unlighted cigar he had been fumbling at a calendar
that hung on the wall over his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;My paper in the Western National isn&#8217;t due
for five days: I dare them to sell it&mdash;to you or
anybody else! As you know perfectly well, it would
be bad banking ethics for a bank to sell the paper
of an old customer. It isn&#8217;t done! I&#8217;ve about
made up my mind to quit the Western, anyhow.
Those fellows over there think they&#8217;ve got the right
to sweat every customer they&#8217;ve got. They&#8217;re not
bankers; they&#8217;ve got the souls of pawnbrokers and
ought to be making loans on household goods at
forty per cent a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Eaton calmly, &#8220;has nothing to
do with the matter in hand. I understand that you
decline my offer, which is to take up the Western&#8217;s
notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, mighty right! You wouldn&#8217;t
accept such an offer yourself, Eaton. If I were to
come to you with a mysterious offer to advance
you money, you&#8217;d turn me out of your office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; Eaton assented. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t
undertake to defend the idea; I confess that it&#8217;s
indefensible. As I understand you, you&#8217;ve passed
on the matter finally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied Copeland sharply.</p>

<p>Eaton rose. He bent his gaze with an absent air
upon the calendar, as though surprised to find it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
there. Then, seeming to recall that he had finished
his errand, he walked to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Copeland,&#8221; he said;
and passed out.</p>

<p>Jerry Amidon paused in the act of shaking hands
with a country customer to stare at the departing
figure, but Eaton stalked austerely into the street
quite unmindful of him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>FATE AND BILLY COPELAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nan left Copeland the night of the Kinney
party she promised to call him the next day. As
telephoning from home was hazardous, she made
an excuse for going downtown and called from a
department store. Copeland was not in, and she
repeated her call several times without reaching
him. Copeland, if she had known it, was in the
directors&#8217; room at the Western National, discussing
his affairs with the president.</p>

<p>She had a superstitious awe of petty frustrations
of her plans and hopes. The Celt in her was alert
for signs and miraculous interventions. It occurred
to her that perhaps the angels of light or darkness
were bent upon interfering; the idea kindled her
imagination.</p>

<p>In the street she ran into Fanny Copeland. To
meet Billy&#8217;s former wife, just when she was trying
to perfect plans for marrying Billy, was altogether
dismaying.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear child, I&#8217;m so glad to see you!&#8221; cried
Fanny, taking both Nan&#8217;s hands. &#8220;I was just
wondering whether I had time to run up to the
house. How is Mr. Farley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa hasn&#8217;t been quite so well,&#8221; Nan answered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
&#8220;but it&#8217;s only a slight cold. I had to come downtown
on an errand,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>She experienced once more a feeling of self-consciousness,
of unreality, in meeting Fanny face to
face: within a day or two she might be another
Mrs. Copeland! And yet Billy had once loved this
woman, undeniably; and she had loved him&mdash;she
might, for all Nan knew, still love him. She
envied the little woman her equanimity, her poise,
her good cheer. If she were only like that, instead
of the wobbly weather-vane she knew herself to be!
Why hadn&#8217;t she a firm grip on life instead of a
succession of fatuous clutches at nothing! Nan
wished, as she had wished a thousand times, that
troublesome problems would not rise up to vex
her.</p>

<p>The Farley chauffeur had run his machine to the
sidewalk to pick her up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope your father will be better soon,&#8221; said
Fanny. &#8220;Give him my love, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan&#8217;s eyes followed her as the car got under way.</p>

<p>When she reached home she met a special delivery
messenger at the door. Her heart jumped; it was
a note from Billy, who had risked sending her a
message that might very easily have fallen under
her foster-father&#8217;s eye. She thrust it into her pocket
unopened and ran upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re back again, are you?&#8221; Farley said
harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa; I had an errand I couldn&#8217;t put off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been a mystery to me,&#8221; he grumbled,
&#8220;what women find to trot downtown for so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pins!&#8221; she replied lightly. &#8220;We always need
little things. I met Mrs. Copeland&mdash;looking for
pins, too; so you see I&#8217;m not the only one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw <i>her</i>, did you?&#8221; he asked with a show
of eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I met her as I was coming out of Sterling&#8217;s.
She was just starting home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been hoping she&#8217;d stop in to see me, but
she&#8217;s a busy woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has a lot to do, of course. If you&#8217;d like
to see her I&#8217;ll telephone her to come in for luncheon
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appeared to be pondering this and his
hands opened and shut several times before he
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; never mind. She&#8217;s busy and it really
doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; He stared vacantly at the ceiling
for a moment. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all fixed now,&#8221;
he added musingly, apparently forgetting her.</p>

<p>She was anxious to be off to her room to read
Billy&#8217;s note; but she lingered, curious as to what
further he might have to say about Fanny.</p>

<p>&#8220;You like that woman, don&#8217;t you, Nan? You
and she get on&mdash;you haven&#8217;t found any traces
of ill-feeling toward you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His small gray eyes were bent upon her with an
odd expression of mingled hostility and kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I like her, papa; and I believe she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
likes me. There&#8217;s no reason why she shouldn&#8217;t
like me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No reason!&#8221; he caught her up contemptuously.</p>

<p>She knew that he was thinking of Billy. His
face twitched as a wave of anger seized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man is a scoundrel!&#8221; he blurted. &#8220;If he
hadn&#8217;t been he&#8217;d never have treated that woman
as he did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to worry her much!&#8221; she
flashed back at him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a happier
woman anywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>She realized instantly that the remark was unfortunate.
He pointed a shaking finger at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That woman,&#8221; he said, pronouncing the words
with ominous deliberation, &#8220;ought to get down on
her knees every night and thank God that she&#8217;s
rid of him! That great bully, that worthless loafer!
But I&#8217;ll show him a few things! If that blackguard
thinks he can put anything over on me he&#8217;ll find
that I&#8217;m smarter than he thinks I am! You remember
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be quiet, Mr. Farley,&#8221; admonished
Miss Rankin, who had been standing by the window;
&#8220;the doctor said you weren&#8217;t to excite yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not excited,&#8221; he flared. &#8220;Doctors and lawyers
make a nice mess of this world. They don&#8217;t
any of &#8217;em know anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave himself an impatient twitch and several
documents slipped from under his pillow. He
clutched them nervously and thrust them back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Nan was jubilant for a moment in the knowledge
that she knew what those documents contained&mdash;devices
for humiliating her after he was
gone. If only he knew how little she cared! He
thought of nothing but his money and means of
keeping it from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away; I want to think,&#8221; he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Nan was grateful for this dismissal, and a moment
later had softly closed her door and was
eagerly reading Copeland&#8217;s message. It covered
three letter-sheets and the daring of its contents
caused her heart to beat wildly.</p>

<p>What he proposed was immediate marriage.
There was to be a military wedding that night at
the church in the next block. Nan, he assumed,
would attend. At the end of the ceremony she had
merely to pass out of the church and his machine
would be waiting around the corner. She could
pack a suit-case, ostensibly filled with articles for
the cleaner&#8217;s, and he would have a messenger call
for it. They would run up to Lafayette, where he
had a married cousin who would have a minister
ready to marry them; then take a train for Chicago
and return the next day and have it out with
Farley.</p>

<p>Nan had never shared Copeland&#8217;s faith in the
idea that once they were married they might safely
rely on Farley&#8217;s forgiveness. Farley&#8217;s passionate
outbreaks at the mere mention of Copeland pretty
effectually disposed of that hope. But that was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
so important, for, in spite of Farley&#8217;s unfavorable
opinion of Copeland&#8217;s business capacity and Billy&#8217;s
own complaint of hard times, she had an idea that
Copeland was well off, if not rich. To outward appearances,
the drug business was as flourishing
now as in the days when Farley was still active in
its affairs. It was the way of business men to &#8220;talk
poor&#8221; even when they were most prosperous; this
had, at least, always been Farley&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>The gaunt figure in the room across the hall rose
wraithlike before her, giving her pause. Yes, the
Farleys had been kind to her; they had caught her
away from the world&#8217;s rough hand and had done
all that it was in their power to do to make a decent,
self-respecting woman of her. Her advantages had
been equal to those enjoyed by most of the girls
she knew. Many people&mdash;the town&#8217;s &#8220;old stock,&#8221;
Farley&#8217;s substantial neighbors&mdash;would see nothing
romantic or amusing in her flight with Copeland.
They would call her the basest ingrate; she
could fancy them saying that blood will tell; that
after all she was a nobody, a girl without background
or antecedents, whom the Farleys had
picked up, out of the kindness of their simple
hearts, and that she had taken the first chance to
slap them in the face.</p>

<p>Then she remembered the will that had given her
the key to Farley&#8217;s intentions. Possibly the new
will, which Thurston had brought to the house that
day, cut her expectations to an even lower figure....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>It pleased her to think that she was studying the
matter dispassionately, arguing with herself both
for and against Billy&#8217;s plan. It was more honest to
marry Copeland now and be done with it than to
wait and marry him after Farley&#8217;s death. This she
found a particularly satisfying argument in favor of
marrying him at once. Her histrionic sense responded
to the suggestion of an elopement; it would
be a great lark, besides bringing her deliverance
from the iron hand of Farley. Yes; she would do it!
Her pulses tingled as she visualized herself as the
chief figure in an event that would stir the town. It
was now four o&#8217;clock. Copeland had written that
at five a messenger would call for her suit-case,
and all she had to do was to step into his car when
she came out of the church.</p>

<p>She was downstairs listening for the bell when
the messenger rang. As she handed him the suit-case
she felt herself already launched upon a great
adventure. While she was at the door the afternoon
paper arrived and she carried it up to Farley and
read him the headlines.</p>

<p>She had her dinner with him in his room. There
was a pathos in his lean frame, his deep-furrowed
brow, in the restless, gnarled hands. She was not
so happy over her plans as she had expected to be.
She kept saying to herself that it wasn&#8217;t quite
fair&mdash;not an honest return for all the kindnesses
of her foster-parents&mdash;to run away and leave this
broken old man. As she thought of it, every unkind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
word he had said to her had been merited; she had
lied to him, disobeyed him, and tricked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your appetite, Nan?&#8221;
he asked suddenly. &#8220;Seems to me you&#8217;ve looked
a little peaked lately. Maybe you don&#8217;t get enough
exercise now we&#8217;ve got the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m perfectly well,&#8221; she replied hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve been cooped up here all summer.
You&#8217;d better take a trip this winter. We&#8217;ll keep a
lookout for somebody that&#8217;s goin&#8217; South and get
&#8217;em to take you along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t necessary, papa. I never felt
better in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the night for that Parish girl&#8217;s
wedding?&#8221; he asked later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I thought I&#8217;d go,&#8221; she answered carelessly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s at the Congregational Church, and I
can go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; you be sure to go. You never saw an
army wedding? I guess &#8217;most everybody will be
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reminded her that it was time to dress
she answered indifferently that she didn&#8217;t care
to go to the reception, and that the gown she had
on would be perfectly suitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just watch the show from a back seat, papa;
you can see a wedding better from the rear, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t hurry back on my account.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been afraid that he would raise some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
objection to her going without an escort; but he
made no comment.</p>

<p>She ran her eyes over the things in her room&mdash;photographs
of girls she had known at boarding-school,
trifles for the toilet-table that had been
given her on birthdays and holidays. It was a
big comfortable room, the largest bedroom in the
house, with a window-seat that had been built
specially for her when she came home from school.
She glanced over the trinkets that littered the
mantel, and took from its leathern case a medal
she had won in school for excellence in recitations.
On the wall hung a photograph of herself as Rosalind,
a part she had played in an out-of-doors presentation
of &#8220;As You Like It.&#8221;...</p>

<p>She must leave some explanation of her absence&mdash;so
she sat down at her desk and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Dear Papa</i>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t be hard on me, but I&#8217;ve run away
to marry Mr. Copeland. We are going to Lafayette
to his cousin&#8217;s and shall be married at her house
to-night. I hope you won&#8217;t be hard on me; I shall
explain everything to you when I see you and I
think you will understand. We shall be back very
soon and I will let you know where I shall be.</p>
</div>

<p>She hesitated a moment and then closed with
&#8220;Your loving daughter, Nan.&#8221; She thrust this
into an envelope, addressed it in a bold hand to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Timothy Farley, Esq., and placed it under a small
silver box on the mantel.</p>

<p>She stood a moment at the door, then closed it
softly and went in to say good-night to Farley. He
took the hand on which she had half-drawn her
glove and held it while his eyes slowly surveyed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;d wear a hat to
an evening wedding. I never know about those
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is such a foolish little thing, papa;
you&#8217;d hardly call it a hat,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let one of those army officers pick
you up and carry you off. I want to hold on to you
a little longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she bent to kiss him tears sprang to her eyes.
Face to face with it, there was nothing heroic,
nothing romantic in abandoning the kindest friend
she was ever likely to know, and in a fashion so
shamelessly abrupt and cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, papa!&#8221; she cried bravely and
tripped downstairs, humming to keep up her
courage.</p>

<p>She absently took her latch-key from a bowl on
the hall table and did not remember until she had
thrust it into her glove as she went down the steps
that she would have no use for it. It was the finest
of autumn nights and many were walking to the
church; there was a flutter of white raiment, and
a festal gayety marked the street. She waited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
those immediately in sight to pass before leaving
the yard and then walked toward the church.</p>

<p>She eluded an officer resplendent in military
dress who started toward her and stole into the
nearest seat. The subdued happiness that seemed
to thrill the atmosphere, the organist&#8217;s preludings,
the air of expectancy intensified her sense of detachment
and remoteness.</p>

<p>The notes of the &#8220;Lohengrin&#8221; march roused her
from her reverie and she craned her neck for a first
sight of the attendants and the bride.</p>

<p>Just before the benediction she left, and was soon
in the side street where Billy was to leave his car.
She had expected him to be in readiness, but he
had evidently waited for the end of the ceremony&mdash;which
seemed absurd when they were so soon to
have a wedding of their own! It was inconsiderate
of him to keep her waiting. The street began to fill
and she loitered, ill at ease, while the organ trumpeted
joyfully.</p>

<p>Then she saw the familiar white roadster, with
Billy in the chauffeur&#8217;s seat, turning into the side
street where several policemen were already directing
the movements of the parked carriages and
motors toward the church entrance. His overcoat
was flung open and the light of the lamp at the intersecting
streets smote upon his shirt bosom. It was
ridiculous for him to have put on evening clothes
and a silk hat when he had a long drive before him!
The policemen bawled to him not to interfere with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the traffic. Ignoring their signals he drove his car
forward. Nan watched with mounting anger the
disturbance he was creating. The crowd that had
assembled in the hope of catching a glimpse of the
bride now found Copeland and his altercation with
the police much more diverting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Copeland&#8217;s drunk again,&#8221; some one behind
Nan remarked contemptuously.</p>

<p>The white car suddenly darted forward and
crashed into a motor that was advancing in line
toward the corner, causing a stampede among the
waiting vehicles.</p>

<p>While the police were separating the two cars,
Nan caught sight of Eaton, who seemed to be trying
to persuade the policemen of Copeland&#8217;s good intentions.
Billy&#8217;s voice was perfectly audible to the
spectators as he demanded to be let alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t got any right to block this street;
it&#8217;s against the law to shut up a street that way!&#8221;</p>

<p>The policemen dragged him from the seat and a
chauffeur from one of the waiting cars jumped in
and backed the machine out of the way. Nan
waited uncertainly to see what disposition the
police were making of Billy; but having lifted the
blockade they left him to his own devices. He had
been drinking; that was the only imaginable explanation
of his conduct, and her newly established
confidence in him was gone. However, it
would be best to wait and attempt to speak to
him, as he might mingle in the crowd and make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
inquiries for her that would publish the fact that
they had planned flight.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard her name spoken, and turned
to find Eaton beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad about Copeland,&#8221; he remarked in his
usual careless fashion; &#8220;but one of those policemen
promised to see that he went home.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was bewildered by his sudden appearance.
Eaton never missed anything; he would certainly
make note of her gown and hat as not proper for
occasions of highest ceremony. Nor was it likely
that he had overlooked the two suitcases strapped
to the rear of Billy&#8217;s car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looked for you all over the church, and had
given you up,&#8221; Eaton was saying. &#8220;You can&#8217;t say
no&mdash;simply got to have you! Stupid to be pulling
off a wedding the night we&#8217;re dedicating the new
swimming-pool at the Wright Settlement House.
Programme all shot to pieces, but Mamie Pembroke&#8217;s
going to sing and you&#8217;ve got to do a recitation.
Favor to an old friend! They dumped the
full responsibility on me at six o&#8217;clock&mdash;six, mind
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan bewildered, uncertain, suffered him to pilot
her round the corner, wondering how much he
knew, and trying to adjust herself to this new situation.
A car that she recognized as the Pembrokes&#8217;
stood at the curb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come right along, Nan; there&#8217;s no use saying
you won&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Mamie Pembroke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>The Pembrokes were among those who had
dropped her after she became identified with the
Kinneys, and her rage at Copeland was mitigated
by their cordiality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mamie! What on earth do you want
with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a lark; one of this crazy Eaton man&#8217;s
ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan knew that she had been recognized by many
people, and that even if Copeland had not made
a fool of himself the elopement was now out of the
question. She felt giddy and leaned heavily on
Eaton&#8217;s arm as he helped her into the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were alone, weren&#8217;t you, Nan?&#8221; Eaton
asked as the machine started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she faltered, settling back into a seat
beside Mrs. Pembroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better stop at your house so Mr.
Farley won&#8217;t be troubled about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she had not meant to return at all, it seemed
absurd to go back now to say that she was going
to a settlement house entertainment and would be
home in an hour or so. The telltale letter could
hardly have been found yet and she must dispose
of it immediately. The car whirled round to the
Farleys&#8217; and Nan let herself in with her key.</p>

<p>Farley was awake, reading a magazine article
on &#8220;The Ohio in the Civil War.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back already! Getting married doesn&#8217;t take
long, does it?&mdash;not as long as getting out of it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;Oh, the wedding was stunning!&#8221; she cried
breathlessly. &#8220;I never saw so much gold braid in
my life. I&#8217;m going with the Pembrokes and Mr.
Eaton down to dedicate a swimming-pool at the
Wright Settlement House. I just stopped to tell
you, so you wouldn&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Pembroke going down there?&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;I thought that tank was for poor boys. What&#8217;s
Eaton got to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She explained that Eaton was substituting for
the president of the Settlement House Association,
who had been called from town, and that he had
asked her to recite something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8216;The Ole Swimmin&#8217; Hole&#8217; will come in
handy. I always like the way you do that. Run
along now!&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted into her room and found the letter
just as she had left it on the mantel. She tore it
into strips and threw them into her beribboned
waste-paper basket. Her revulsion of feeling was
complete. It was like waking from a nightmare to
find herself secure amid familiar surroundings. She
turned to Farley&#8217;s room again and impulsively
bent and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you gone yet?&#8221; he demanded, with the
gruffness that often concealed his pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off for sure this time,&#8221; she called back.
&#8220;Thanks for suggesting &#8216;The Ole Swimmin&#8217; Hole&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
just the thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the hall packed with an impatient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
crowd. Eaton led the way to the platform and
opened the exercises without formality. The superintendent
of the house dealt in statistics as to the
service rendered by the Settlement. Mamie Pembroke
sang &#8220;The Rosary&#8221; and responded to an
encore.</p>

<p>Nan had not faced so large an audience since her
appearance as Rosalind at school. She drew off her
gloves before her name was announced, and as she
stood up put aside her hat. At least half a dozen
nationalities were represented in the auditorium;
and she resolved to try first a sketch in which an
Irishman, an Italian and a German debated in brisk
dialogue the ownership of a sum of money. She had
heard it done in vaudeville by a comedian of reputation
and had mastered it for dinner-table uses. She
had added to it, recast, and improved it, and she
now gave it with all the spirit and nice differentiation
of which she was capable. Eaton, who had
heard her several times before, was surprised at her
success; she had taken pains; and how often Eaton,
in thinking of Nan, had wished she would take
pains!</p>

<p>There was no ignoring the demand for more, and
she gave another comic piece and added &#8220;The Ole
Swimmin&#8217; Hole&#8221; for good measure. She received
her applause graciously and sat down wondering
at her own happiness. Mrs. Pembroke patted her
hand; she heard somebody saying, &#8220;Yes, Farley&#8217;s
daughter,&mdash;adopted her when she was a child!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Eaton was announcing the close of the programme.
It was his pleasant office, he said, to deliver
the natatorium that had been added to the
Settlement House into the keeping of the people of
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many lives go to the making of a city like this.
Most of you know little of the men who have built
this city, but you profit by their care and labor as
much as though you and your fathers had been
born here. It is the hope of all of us who come
here to meet you and to help you, if we can, that
you may be builders yourselves, adding to the dignity
and honor and prosperity of the community.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, only one man besides myself knows who
gave the money for the building of the swimming-pool.
The other man is the donor himself. He is
one of the old merchants of this city, a man known
for his honesty and fair dealing. He told me not
to mention his name; and I&#8217;m not going to do it.
But I think that if some one who is very dear to
him&mdash;the person who is the dearest of all in the
world to him&mdash;should hand the keys to the superintendent,
I should not be telling&mdash;and yet, you
would understand who this kind friend is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the platform and handed Nan a bunch
of keys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he said, turning to the interested
spectators, &#8220;that you will be glad to know that the
keys to the bathhouse have come to you through
Miss Farley.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Tears sprang to Nan&#8217;s eyes as she rose and handed
the keys to the superintendent amid cheers and
applause. She was profoundly moved by the demonstration.
They did not know&mdash;those simple
foreign folk who lifted their faces in gratitude and
admiration&mdash;that an hour earlier it had been in
her heart to commit an act of grossest ingratitude
against their benefactor. She turned away with
infinite relief that the exercises were over, and
followed the rest of the visitors to inspect the house.
It was like Farley not to tell any one of his gift;
and she felt like a fraud and a cheat to stand in his
place, receiving praise that was intended for him.</p>

<p>On the way home she was very quiet. The many
emotions of the day had so wearied her that she had
no spirit to project herself into the future. And it
seemed futile to attempt to forecast a day&#8217;s events,
when she had, apparently, so little control of her
own destiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope Mr. Farley won&#8217;t abuse me for giving
him away?&#8221; Eaton remarked, as he left her at the
door. &#8220;But the temptation was too strong&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
resist putting you into the picture. Your
recitations made a big hit; and those people are
real critics!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay in the window-seat till daybreak, dreaming,
staring at the stars.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>AN ABRUPT ENDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> sang as she dressed the next morning. The
gods had ordained that she shouldn&#8217;t marry Billy,
and after her uncertainties on that point she was
relieved to find that the higher powers had taken
the troublesome business out of her hands. She
was surprised at her light-hearted acceptance of the
situation. She hadn&#8217;t married Billy and she sang
in the joy of her freedom.</p>

<p>Just as she was ready to leave her room the maid
brought up a special delivery letter from Copeland.
It had been posted at six o&#8217;clock. She tore open
the envelope and read frowningly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Dear Nan</i>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Sorry about the row at the church last night.
Never occurred to me that there&#8217;d be such a jam.
I hung around the neighborhood as long as I could,
hoping to find you. But it will be nicer, after all, to
make the run by daylight. Telephone me where we
can meet this morning, say at ten. I shall be at the
office early and shall expect to hear from you by
nine-thirty. For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t fail me, Nan!</p>
</div>

<p>This was scrawled in pencil on Hamilton Club
paper. She propped it against her dressing-table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
mirror and stared at it wonderingly. It did not
seem possible that she had ever contemplated running
away with Billy. The remembrance of him as
he sat in his car, quarreling with the police, with the
eyes of a hundred people upon him, sickened her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Either you love me, Nan, or you don&#8217;t; you
either have been fooling me all along or you mean
to stand by me now and make me the happiest man
alive....</p>
</div>

<p>She smiled at Billy&#8217;s efforts to be pathetic&mdash;a
quizzical little smile. The paper smelt odiously of
tobacco smoke. She tore the note to pieces and let
them slip slowly from her hand into her waste-basket.
No; she did not love Billy. Only a few
hours earlier she had been ready to run away with
him; but that was all over now. She was sorry for
Billy, but she did not love him. How could she
have ever been foolish enough to think she did!
But why, she wondered, was she forever yielding to
impulses from which a kind fate might not always
protect her? &#8220;You little fool!&#8221; she ejaculated.
A moment later she stood smiling in Farley&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan, look here what they say about you in the
paper!&#8221; he said, glancing at her over his spectacles.
&#8220;I told Eaton not to blab about that swimmin&#8217;-tank
business and here they&#8217;ve got us all in the
paper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only you could have been there, papa!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>She saw that he was pleased. He bade her ring
for the maid to bring up their breakfast; he wanted
to know all about the exercises at the Settlement
House.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you made a hit all right,&#8221; he said
proudly, after making her read the account aloud.
&#8220;I never liked your sayin&#8217; pieces in public; but I
guess if you can tickle a crowd like that I ain&#8217;t got
any right to kick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporter had built his story around her;
and had done full justice to her part in the surprise
of the evening. Her recitations were praised extravagantly
as worthy of a professional; &#8220;it is unfortunate,&#8221;
ran the article, &#8220;that Miss Farley&#8217;s
elocutionary talents are so rarely displayed in
public.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was compensation for much greater catastrophes
than the loss of Billy Copeland to find
Farley so pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind o&#8217; nice to do things like that&mdash;to do
things for people,&#8221; Farley remarked wistfully, after
subjecting Nan to a prolonged cross-examination.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry now I didn&#8217;t tell you about that swimmin&#8217; pool.
You&#8217;ve got a mighty kind heart, Nan.
I used to think I wouldn&#8217;t make any will, but let
what I&#8217;ve got go to you, and leave it to you to
help some of these schemes for the poor. You
know you&#8217;ve worried me sometimes&mdash;we won&#8217;t
talk about that any more; I guess it&#8217;s all over
now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The questioning look he bent upon her gave her
conscience a twinge. If Billy hadn&#8217;t become embroiled
with the police she would not be listening
to Farley&#8217;s praise!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa; it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; she replied softly, and
bent down and kissed him.</p>

<p>When later she called Copeland on the telephone
it was to laugh at their misadventure&mdash;it seemed
safer to make light of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please forget all about it, Billy. It wasn&#8217;t my
fault or yours either; it was all wrong any way.
No&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was talking from his desk at the store and
as he began to argue she dismissed him firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be cross, Billy. You ought to be
as glad as I am that we didn&#8217;t do it. No; never
again! Cheer up; that&#8217;s a nice boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung up on his angry reply.</p>

<p>Nan spent all day at home virtuously addressing
herself to household affairs, much to the surprise
of the cook and maid.</p>

<p>Mamie Pembroke stopped to leave a huge bunch
of chrysanthemums for Mr. Farley. He sent for
her to come to his room and asked her all about
the evening at the Settlement House. Mamie&#8217;s
appearance added to his happiness. He had been
deeply grieved when Mamie and the Harrington
girls dropped Nan; it was a good sign that they
were beginning to evince a renewed interest in her.
He attributed the change in their attitude to Nan&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
abandonment of Copeland and the Kinneys, never
dreaming in his innocence of the quiet missionary
work that Eaton had been doing with the cautious
mothers of these young women.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better give Nan some work to do on some
of your charity schemes, Mamie. She&#8217;s been shut
up here with me so much she hasn&#8217;t got around with
the rest of you girls as I want her to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t think I do so much! Mamma does
it for the whole family. I&#8217;m sure Nan does as much
as any of the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for your kind words, Mamie; you know
perfectly well they dropped me from the Kindergarten
Board for cutting all the meetings. But I
think we all ought to help in these things. It certainly
opened my eyes to see that crowd down there
last night; I had no idea the Settlement had grown
so big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you and Mamie would go down and look
at the Boys&#8217; Club sometime. They&#8217;ve only got a
tumble-down house, but they&#8217;re talkin&#8217; of doin&#8217;
something better. A poor boy has a mighty hard
time. When I was a boy down on the Ohio&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The story was a familiar one to Nan, and as he
talked her thoughts reverted to the will in which
his provisions for the Boys&#8217; Club had so angered
her.</p>

<p>All day she marveled at her happiness, her newly-awakened
unselfishness. In her gratitude for what
she sincerely believed to have been a providential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
deliverance from Copeland she voluntarily gave
the nurse the night off.</p>

<p>Her good cheer had communicated itself to Farley.
The nurse was a nuisance, he said, and he
would soon be well enough to dispense with her
altogether. Over the supper they ate together in
his room she exerted herself to amuse him and he
proved unusually amiable. The afternoon paper&#8217;s
account of his gift of the swimming-pool revived
this as a topic of conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done as much as I ought to for the
poor and unlucky. I expect they&#8217;ve called me a
pretty hard specimen; and I&#8217;ve turned down lots
of these people that&#8217;s always chasin&#8217; round with
subscription papers. But I always had an idea I&#8217;d
like to do something that would count. I&#8217;m sorry
now I didn&#8217;t give those Boys&#8217; Club folks a boost
while I could see the money spent myself. I&#8217;ve
tried makin&#8217; wills and ain&#8217;t sure about any of &#8217;em.
I got a good mind to burn &#8217;em all, Nan, and leave it
up to you to give away what you think&#8217;s right. Only
I wouldn&#8217;t want you to feel bound to do it. These
things don&#8217;t count for much unless you feel in
your heart you want to do &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to divert his thoughts to other channels,
but he persisted in discussing ways and means
of helping the poor and unfortunate. She was surprised
at his intimate knowledge of local philanthropic
organizations; for a number of them he
expressed the greatest contempt, as impractical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
likely to do harm. Others he commended warmly
and urged her to acquaint herself with their methods
and needs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to do those things ourselves, while
we&#8217;re alive. You can&#8217;t tell what they&#8217;ll do
with your money after you&#8217;re dead,&#8221; he kept
repeating.</p>

<p>She wondered whether he regretted now having
made the will that had caused her so much anguish.
Perhaps.... But her resentment had vanished.
His solicitude for friendless boys, based upon his
own forlorn youth, impressed her deeply. It was
out of the same spirit that he had lifted her from
poverty&mdash;she had even greater cause for gratitude
and generosity than he, and she said so in terms
that touched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think of those things any more,
papa,&#8221; she said finally. &#8220;If you have a bad night,
Miss Rankin will give me a scolding. I&#8217;m going to
read you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he acquiesced. &#8220;To-morrow I&#8217;ll
talk to you some more about my will. It&#8217;s worried
me a whole lot; I want to do the right thing, Nan;
I want you to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know that, papa; I&#8217;d be a mighty
stupid girl if I didn&#8217;t; so don&#8217;t waste your strength
arguing with me. You&#8217;ve been talking too much;
what shall I read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t read me any of this new-fangled stuff.
Take down &#8216;Huck Finn&#8217; and read that chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
about the two crooks Huck meets on the river.
You ain&#8217;t read me that lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay very quiet until she had finished the
chapter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; he said absently. &#8220;You run
along now. I&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the hall she met the maid coming to announce
a caller.</p>

<p>Jerry, chastely attired in a new fall suit, greeted
her with the ambassadorial dignity that he assumed
for social occasions, with apologies to J. C. E.
He could bow and shake hands like his idol and
mentor, and though his manner of speech was still
his own, he had greatly subdued its original violences.
The area of collar and cuff that could be sustained
on a salary lately increased to eighty dollars
a month might provoke smiles; but Jerry was not
troubled. By discreetly soliciting custom for a
tailor who made a twenty-five dollar suit which
only the most sophisticated sartorial critic could
distinguish from a sixty-dollar creation, he got his
clothes at a discount. While he had not yet acquired
a dress-suit or a silk hat, he boasted a dinner-coat
and a cutaway. He had dedicated the latter by
wearing it boldly to Christ Church, where he was
ushered to the third pew from the chancel and placed
beside a lady whose kneelings and risings he imitated
sedulously. This was Eaton&#8217;s church, and
while that gentleman was not present on that
particular morning, a tablet commemorating his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
father&#8217;s virtues (twenty years warden and vestry-man)
gave Jerry a thrill of pride and a sense
of perspective. His mother had been a Campbellite,
and a vested clergy and choir, sprung
upon him suddenly, had awed him to a mood of
humility.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been wondering as I came up what I&#8217;d do
if you were out: I couldn&#8217;t decide whether to jump
in the river or lie down in the middle of the street
and be killed by a large, fat auto. Nan,&#8221;&mdash;he held
her hand and gazed into her face with tragic intensity,&mdash;&#8220;Nan,
you have saved my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>She met him promptly on his own ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have worn mourning for you, Jerry;
you may be sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thought seems to give you pleasure. But
I like you best in blue&mdash;that suit you had on the
day we paddled up the river still haunts me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was a last year&#8217;s bird-nest. I have a
lot better clothes than that, but I don&#8217;t wear them
to picnics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be dazzling in anything; I&#8217;m dead sure
of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran on in his usual key for some time, and
then rose abruptly and walked toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we quite alone?&#8221; he whispered tragically.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; she replied, imitating his tone. &#8220;I
hope you don&#8217;t mean to rob the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t come to steal; I&#8217;ve
brought you a large beautiful present.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>This she assumed to be the preliminary to a joke
of some kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left it behind that big rosebush in the yard
and I&#8217;ll bring it in&mdash;nobody likely to come&mdash;no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the nurse is out and I just now heard the
maid climbing the back stairs to her room.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smothered &#8220;Oh!&#8221; greeted him as he reappeared
bearing the suit-case she had entrusted to Copeland&#8217;s
messenger the day before. He placed it
quietly by the door, a little shame-facedly, in spite
of his efforts to pass the matter off lightly. Nan
flushed, staring at him defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw this down at the works and I just thought
I&#8217;d bring it up. Maybe,&#8221; he said reflectively, &#8220;it
ain&#8217;t yours; but I thought I&#8217;d take a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N. F.&#8221; neatly printed on the end of the bag
advertised its ownership to any observant eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I are good friends, I hope,&#8221; she said
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Nan; if we&#8217;re not, what are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not a question she cared to debate; the
immediate matter was the narrowness of her escape
from a marriage with Copeland and just what she
should tell Jerry about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you know about&mdash;<i>that</i>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I make it my business never to know anything!
I don&#8217;t want to know anything about that bag. So
we&#8217;ll just forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that her eyes rested nervously on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
suit-case, he carried it into the hall out of range of
any chance caller&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said absently as he came back.
He began speaking volubly of the delights of
&#8220;Ivanhoe&#8221; which Eaton had lately given him to
read.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many people know about&mdash;<i>that</i>?&#8221; she
demanded, breaking in sharply upon his praise of
Scott.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the bag? Not a soul; I told you not to
worry about that. I found it behind the door in his
private office. Purely accidental&mdash;honest, it was!
He wasn&#8217;t feeling well to-day,&#8221; he added. &#8220;He
hung around the store all morning looking pretty
glum and didn&#8217;t show up at all this afternoon. I
went to the club and fished him out about six o&#8217;clock
and took him home in a taxi. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reduced to terms, Billy had characteristically
celebrated the failure of the elopement by continuing
the drunk he had begun the night before.
Her good luck had not deserted her if no one but
Jerry knew that her suit-case, packed for flight,
had stood all day in Copeland&#8217;s office. Jerry&#8217;s intuitions
were too keen for her to attempt dissimulation.
It would be better to confess and assure
herself of his secrecy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to worry about that little
matter, Nan,&#8221; Jerry continued reassuringly. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s
going to know anything about it. Nobody
<i>does</i> know anything about it&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;Mr. Eaton?&#8221; she suggested faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Cecil for two days. I&#8217;ve told
you all there is to tell. I don&#8217;t know any more
and I don&#8217;t want to know. Now, forget it!
Only&#8221;&mdash;he deliberated a moment and then added
brokenly&mdash;&#8220;only, for God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t ever try
it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>It flashed upon her suddenly that the presence
of her suit-case in Copeland&#8217;s office was susceptible
of grave misconstruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you the whole story, Jerry;
I think I&#8217;ll feel happier if I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to tell me anything;
remember that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not, Jerry. But I feel that having
known me away back in the old times, you&#8217;ll understand
better than anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an appeal in this that filled his heart
with pride. He was struck with humility that a
girl like Nan should confide in him. He had not yet
recovered from his surprise that she tolerated him
at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t think I was going to do anything
wrong, Jerry,&#8221; she said pleadingly; &#8220;we were to
have been married last night; it wasn&#8217;t&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t
anything worse!&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221; he gasped; &#8220;don&#8217;t say things like <i>that</i>!
I wouldn&#8217;t think it&mdash;I hadn&#8217;t thought it of him!
And you&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might have thought it,&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
with a despairing note; &#8220;but you didn&#8217;t because
you&#8217;re my good friend and a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so astounded by her unsparing self-condemnation
that he almost missed this heart-warming
praise. She hurried on with the story, tears
filling her eyes. It was an undreamed-of thing that
he should see his divinity weep. For the first time
in his life he felt that he, too, was capable of tears.
But he must restore her equanimity, and before
she concluded he had decided to pass the whole
thing off as a joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it, Nan! You never really meant to do
it, anyhow. If Cecil hadn&#8217;t turned up, it&#8217;s a safe
bet you&#8217;d have weakened before you got into the
boss&#8217;s machine. It was a good joke&mdash;on the boss;
that&#8217;s all I see in it. Come on, now, and give a
merry ha-ha. The only sad thing about it is that
it put the boss on the blink all day. If he&#8217;d been
a real sport he wouldn&#8217;t have let you escape so easy;
looks as though he wasn&#8217;t exactly crazy about it
himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you think he wasn&#8217;t!&#8221; she flared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d get a rise out of you with that!
Take it from me, if I&#8217;d framed up a thing like that
I&#8217;d &#8217;ve pulled up large shade trees and upset tall
buildings putting it over. But all you&#8217;ve got to
do is to charge it up to profit and loss. Hereafter
you&#8217;d better not make any engagements without
seeing me,&#8221; he concluded daringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be something in that,&#8221; she laughed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I told you, Jerry. It helps a lot to tell
your troubles to some one&mdash;and you don&#8217;t think
much worse of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, too much sympathy wouldn&#8217;t be good for
you!&#8221; he said, looking at her fixedly. &#8220;Your trouble
is, Nan, if you will take it from an old friend, that
you&#8217;ve had too soft a time. You need a jar or two
to make you watch the corners. So do I; so does
everybody! When things come easy for me I get
nervous. I&#8217;ve got to have something to fight; but
I don&#8217;t mean punching heads; not any more. Cecil
says his great aim in life is to teach me to fight with
my brains instead of my fists and feet. But it&#8217;s
hard work, considering the number of heads there
are that need punching.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was touched by his anxiety to serve her, to
see her always in the best possible light. He was
a comforting person, this Jerry. His philosophy was
much sounder than her own; he was infinitely wiser.
He had done much better with his life than she had
with hers, and the advantages had been so immensely
in her favor! There was no one else in the
world, she reflected, to whom she could confide
as in him. She marveled that she trusted him so
implicitly&mdash;and he knew how little she merited
trust! A sudden impulse carried her across the
room to where he stood fingering a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good to me, Jerry!&#8221; she said with
deep feeling.</p>

<p>Her hand touched his&mdash;a light, caressing stroke;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
then she sprang away from him, abashed. The
color mounted to his face, and he thrust the hand
awkwardly into his pocket. The touch of her hand
had thrilled him; a wave of tenderness swept
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be good to you; I want to help you
if I can,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>But he was afraid of Nan in tears, and there
were tears in the eyes with which she now regarded
him. She turned away, slipping her handkerchief
from her sleeve. This would never do. He waited
a moment, then began talking, as though nothing
had happened, of old times on the river, of steamboat
men and their ways, in the hope of restoring
her tranquillity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I had my share of fun down there; if I
could be a kid again I&#8217;d want to be born right down
there on the old Ohio. I remember once&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A muffled crash in the room above sent her flying
into the hall and upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa!&#8221; she called, standing in the doorway of
Farley&#8217;s room and fumbling for the electric button.</p>

<p>As the ceiling lights flooded the room she called
loudly to Jerry.</p>

<p>Farley lay on the floor in a crumpled heap. The
crash that had accompanied his collapse had been
due to the overturning of the electric table lamp,
at which he had caught as he felt himself falling.</p>

<p>Jerry was already on his knees beside the prone
figure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Nan snatched the receiver of the telephone from
its bracket and called the regular physician; and
then, remembering another doctor who lived just
around the corner, she summoned him also. Amidon
lifted Farley and placed him on the bed. While
waiting for her numbers she told him where to find
a restorative the doctor had provided for emergencies,
and before she finished telephoning he had
tried vainly to force a spoonful of the liquid between
Farley&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; said Jerry, placing his hand over
the stricken man&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! It can&#8217;t be possible!&#8221; Nan moaned.
&#8220;He&#8217;d been so well to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes both physicians were in the
room. They made a hurried examination, asked
a few questions, and said there was nothing to be
done.</p>

<p>The indomitable spirit of Timothy Farley had
escaped from its prison-house; what was mortal
of him remained strangely white and still. Nan,
kneeling beside the bed, wept softly. Her foster-mother
had died after a brief illness and she had
experienced no such shock as now numbed her.
She had, after all, been closer to Farley than to his
wife. Mrs. Farley, with all her gentleness and
sweetness, had lacked the positive traits that made
Timothy Farley an interesting, masterful character.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be things to do,&#8221; Amidon was saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
gently. &#8220;Do you mind if I tell Mr. Eaton? He&#8217;d
want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I should like him to come,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>Jerry went below with the physicians and called
Eaton on the telephone in the lower hall.</p>

<p>Nan rose and began straightening the room.
Farley had evidently drawn on his dressing-gown
with a view to remaining up some time, and had
walked to the quaint little table that had so long
stood near the window. Nan saw now what had
escaped her when she rushed into the room. The
oblong top of the table had been so turned that it
disclosed a compartment back of the trio of drawers
in which Mrs. Farley had kept her sewing articles.
Four long envelopes lay on the lid; two others had
fallen to the floor and lay among the debris of the
lamp. At a glance she saw that these were similar
to the ones she had seen Farley hiding on several
occasions, and the counterpart of the envelope
containing the will she had read with so much concern.
One of the envelopes was torn twice across,
as though he had intended disposing of it finally.
The others were intact.</p>

<p>She gathered them all together and thrust them
back into the table; then ran her fingers along the
underside of the lid until she found a tiny catch.
Noting the position of this, she drew the top into
place, satisfied herself that the spring had caught,
and rose just as Jerry came back.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>SHADOWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> lay on her bed, fully dressed, on the evening
of the day of the funeral, listening to the sounds of
the street with an uncomfortable sense of strangeness
and isolation. The faint tinkle of the bell
roused her and the maid came up bearing Eaton&#8217;s
card. She had told the girl to excuse her to callers,
but Eaton sent word that he wished particularly
to see her. She appeared before him startlingly
wan and white in her black gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you wanted to be alone, Nan, but there&#8217;s
a matter I must speak to you about, and I thought
it best to do it at once. I shan&#8217;t bother you long.
I left a dinner at the Lawyers&#8217; Club to run up for
a minute; in about an hour I shall be making a
speech; so you needn&#8217;t prepare for a long visit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came. It&#8217;s much harder than I
thought it would be. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t keep Mrs.
Copeland or one of the girls with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you&#8217;re bound to feel it. It came as
a great shock to all of us. A man like your father
can&#8217;t pass out of the world without being missed&mdash;very
deeply missed. He was a real person; a
vivid personality. It has done me good to hear the
fine things said of him; the crowd here at the services<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
showed that he had been held in very deep
affection by all sorts of people.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. The tears had
come into her eyes and he waited for her to control
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be troubling you if I hadn&#8217;t felt
that my business&mdash;if it can be called business&mdash;was
urgent. I&#8217;m taking the liberty of an old friend&mdash;of
yours and of Mr. Farley&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there can&#8217;t be any question of liberty!&#8221; she
protested. &#8220;You&#8217;re always so thoughtful, so kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My purpose is in no sense professional,&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;Mr. Thurston was Mr. Farley&#8217;s lawyer
and he will no doubt confer with you at once on
business matters. He&#8217;s an excellent man; wholly
trustworthy. No one stands higher at our bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know papa had every confidence in him,&#8221;
Nan replied, wondering what Eaton, who looked
very distinguished in his evening clothes, could
have to say to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in relation to that little difficulty&mdash;an unfortunate
but wholly pardonable mistake you made&mdash;you
see I speak frankly&mdash;in reference to a man
named Harlowe, a lawyer from the south part of
the State, in regard to a demand he made on you
some time ago. Mr. Farley explained about it&mdash;all
that he knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan clenched her hands tightly and drew a deep
breath. It was inconceivable that that specter could
reappear to trouble her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered faintly; &#8220;I remember. I
was so grateful to you for your help that night.
I don&#8217;t know what would have happened if you
hadn&#8217;t come just then. Papa was very bitter
about what I did, and of course it was cowardly of
me; and very stupid, not to have advised with
some one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did what seemed perfectly justifiable at
the moment; Mr. Farley saw it that way afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never spoke to me about it again; I have
you to thank for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it was Mr. Farley&#8217;s aim to be just. Now,
about this Harlowe: I don&#8217;t want to alarm you, but
I have found it best to be prepared for difficulties
even where there&#8217;s only a remote chance of having
to confront them. I merely want you to know that
if that man turns up again I&#8217;m ready for him. I
have, in fact, accumulated a considerable amount
of data that can be used against him if he makes
another move. He&#8217;s an unscrupulous blackguard,
a disgrace to the profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that case against my brother is all over
now. He couldn&#8217;t ask for more money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in that particular way,&#8221; Eaton replied
slowly; &#8220;but having succeeded once in frightening
money out of you, he might try it again. I suppose
Mr. Farley never told you what I discovered&mdash;established
with documentary proof that I have
safely put away in my office&mdash;that the Corrigan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
this Harlowe pretended to represent was not in
fact your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on quickly, ignoring the astonishment
and bewilderment written on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man was no more your brother than he
is mine&mdash;you need have no doubts about it. Harlowe&#8217;s
client went to the penitentiary&mdash;quite
properly, no doubt. The poor fellow never knew
how he had been used&mdash;never heard of that money!
I take off my hat to Brother Harlowe&mdash;a shrewd
scoundrel. It&#8217;s because I respect his talents that
I&#8217;ve taken so much pains to look him up! Possibly
you won&#8217;t hear from him at all; then again, you
may. I&#8217;ve given some study to the peculiar moral
nature of persons like Harlowe, and I won&#8217;t deny
that it would please me to have a chance at him&mdash;though,
of course, Mr. Thurston would be quite
as competent to deal with the case as I am. My
aim would be to get rid of him quietly, perhaps by
methods that wouldn&#8217;t appeal to Mr. Thurston.
Please listen to him carefully, if he should come to
you. Concede nothing, but let him go as far as he
will. That&#8217;s all, I think. Pardon me if I look at
my watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of you to warn me,&#8221; she said,
with feeling. &#8220;It&#8217;s horrible to know there are
people plotting against you in the dark. I was
ashamed of myself for yielding as I did when that
man came to me; I knew right away that I had
made a mistake.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Well, as our friend Mr. Amidon would remark,
forget it! forget it! We all make mistakes. I wish
I had never made a worse one than that little slip
of yours,&#8221; he added kindly.</p>

<p>She had always been amused by Eaton&#8217;s oddities,
his mysteriousness; but in this hour of dejection
his sympathy and friendliness warmed her
heart. She rose and stood before him, her hands
clenched at her sides, and demanded passionately:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why am I always doing the wrong thing? Why
do I escape so often when I have every intention of
doing what I know to be wrong? I suppose if I&#8217;d
waited another day I shouldn&#8217;t have sneaked my
money out of the trust company and turned it over
to that man! But I&#8217;ve had escapes I don&#8217;t understand;
something gets in the way and I don&#8217;t&mdash;I
<i>can&#8217;t</i>&mdash;do things I fully mean to do! And I look
back and shudder. Why is that&mdash;can you tell
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his arm with one of his familiar gestures
and inspected his cuff-links absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re seeing things a little black now, that&#8217;s
all, Nan. When you gave up that money you thought
it was the right thing to do. You saw the mistake
yourself the moment after it was done. That&#8217;s just
our human frailty. It&#8217;s our frailties that make life
the grand fight it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not very consoling,&#8221; she replied, with
a rueful smile. &#8220;I suppose we never know how much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
we count in other people&#8217;s lives. Oh, I don&#8217;t mean
that I do&mdash;except to do harm; I was thinking of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyeglasses gleamed as he bent her a swift
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d be very happy to think I&#8217;d been of use
to somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you saved me once from going clear over
the brink! You didn&#8217;t know that, did you?&#8221; she
cried earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly did not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said gravely, &#8220;I shall
never tell you. Are you really sure you don&#8217;t know
what I&#8217;m talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Nan, why do you ask me if I guess
things&mdash;when facts are the consuming passion of
my life! If I was ever of the slightest service to you
it was unconscious good fortune on my part. And
I hope there may be many such occasions! But,
Nan,&#8221;&mdash;he waited until he was quite sure of her
attention,&mdash;&#8220;Nan, we can&#8217;t rely too much on the
man on shore in emergencies. He won&#8217;t always
reach us in time. We&#8217;ve got to mind the thin ice
ourselves&mdash;skate away as soon as we hear it cracking!
We can&#8217;t trust to chance. Luck supports sound
judgment&mdash;mainly. And we&#8217;ve got to fight our
own battles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you&#8217;re a worthless, wobbly person like
me, what are you going to do?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease wobbling! Good-night!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Eaton had not been gone more than five minutes
when a light knock on the glass panel of the front
door startled her. The clocks through the house
had just struck ten and she had dismissed the maid
for the night. The rap was repeated more loudly,
and stealing to the door she drew back a corner of
the curtain and peered out. Copeland stood in the
entry, plainly revealed by the overhead light; his
hand was lifted for another knock.</p>

<p>Her heart throbbed with fear and anger. Billy
had no right to come at this hour in this furtive
fashion&mdash;and on this day, of all days, to the house
of the man who had so cordially hated him. She
waited a moment hoping he would go away, but
he began beating upon the glass.</p>

<p>This clearly would not do, and she drew back the
bolt and opened the door a few inches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go away! You have no right to come
here at this time of night!&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized the door as she was about to close it
and forced his way past her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to see you a minute&mdash;just a minute,&#8221;
he said eagerly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of importance or I
shouldn&#8217;t have come to-night. I thought it best
not to wait. It&#8217;s really a serious matter, Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to come at all,&#8221; she replied
angrily. &#8220;What if the neighbors saw you! they
know I&#8217;m alone. You know this won&#8217;t do; please
go, Billy!&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, walking toward the parlor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
&#8220;that it&#8217;s all right for John Eaton to come when
he pleases, but not for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very different; he rang the bell and
the maid let him in! And he came on a business
matter. You can&#8217;t stay, Billy; you understand
that. You must go at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I came earlier, but saw Eaton&#8217;s silk hat
bobbing in and I&#8217;ve been hanging around waiting
for him to go. I didn&#8217;t care to meet him here; and
as far as business is concerned, maybe mine&#8217;s just
as important as his. You&#8217;ll have to take my word
for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner and tone were amiable. There clearly
was nothing to be gained by debating the question
of his right to be there, but she remained resolutely
in the parlor door, trying to devise some means of
getting rid of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be quick, then,&#8221; she said, without
relaxing her severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I understand that, Nan,&#8221; he agreed readily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s about the property&mdash;no&mdash;don&#8217;t stop
me!&#8221; he exclaimed as she cried out impatiently.
&#8220;You have certain rights and it&#8217;s the business of
your friends to see that you get them. Another
day and it will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to see Mr. Thurston to-morrow; everything&#8217;s
in his hands; you have nothing to do
with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a step toward her and his voice sank
to a whisper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it! Everything is not in his hands.
That&#8217;s what I want to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at him blankly. His excited manner
aroused her curiosity as to what he might have to
say, but it was unlikely that he knew anything of
importance about Farley&#8217;s affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re saying downtown that Farley was a
crank about will-making; he made a lot of wills and
kept them hid. Thurston&#8217;s let that out himself. If
you know this, we can drop that part of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply, and her silence encouraged
him to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, as we all know,&#8221; he began ingratiatingly,
&#8220;that Farley wasn&#8217;t himself at all times. He
probably made wills that he destroyed&mdash;or meant
to destroy. It&#8217;s wholly possible that he vented his
wrath on you at times by cutting down what he
meant to give you, and the next day he&#8217;d be sorry
for it. That would be like him. In old times at the
store he used to blow up with fury one minute and
be as tame as a lamb the next. But there&#8217;s no
reason&mdash;there&#8217;s not the slightest reason why
you should suffer if he died leaving a will lying
around that might rob you of your just inheritance&mdash;that
didn&#8217;t really express his normal attitude
toward you. He never meant to be mean to you;
I&#8217;m satisfied of that; but if there are some of those
wills here in the house&mdash;you would have a right,
considering his condition and all that&mdash;you would
have a right&mdash;you see&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>He had been watching her narrowly for some
sign of interest or encouragement, but finding
neither he broke off without saying just what it
might be right for her to do. However, while he
waited a quick flutter of her lids indicated that she
comprehended. Their eyes met in a long gaze. Her
face grew white and her lips opened several times
before any sound came from them. He had drawn
closer, but he stepped back as he saw horror and
repugnance clearly written in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to talk to me like this! It&#8217;s
too shameful, too terrible!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Nan, don&#8217;t take it that way,&#8221; he begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;How else can I take it! To think that you should
believe me capable of that, Billy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t known that he had treated you like
a brute and that he always carried his vindictiveness
to the limit, I shouldn&#8217;t be here. I don&#8217;t want to
see you cut off with little or nothing when the whole
estate ought to be yours&mdash;<i>will</i> be yours if you don&#8217;t
make a fool of yourself! He had no right to bring
you up as his daughter and then leave you with
nothing. Thurston isn&#8217;t going to protect your
interests; he merely did from time to time what
Farley told him to do, and you won&#8217;t get any help
out of him. If there are different wills hidden
about&mdash;you may know where he hid them&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw out his arms with a gesture meant to
demonstrate the ease with which matters might
be taken into her own hands. In the sobering hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
that had followed Farley&#8217;s death only his great
kindness and generosity had been in her thoughts.
The enormity of what Copeland proposed grew
upon her. She bestirred herself suddenly. She
must not let him think that she was tolerating his
suggestion for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you thought that kind of thing
would appeal to me! That&#8217;s your idea of me,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m appealing to your good sense, Nan; in a
few hours it will be too late, and if you know where
he kept his papers, you can easily look them over
and satisfy yourself as to just what he meant to do;
and then you can do as you like. His last will
would stand; maybe you don&#8217;t know that; and if
it&#8217;s in the house, why shouldn&#8217;t you, at least, have
a look at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> do such a thing!&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there shouldn&#8217;t be any will at all,&#8221; he resumed,
with his eyes fixed upon her intently, &#8220;then
you would inherit everything! The adoption made
you his child in law; there wouldn&#8217;t be any way
of escaping that. It&#8217;s these wills that you&#8217;ve got
to fear&mdash;the whims, the sudden vindictive anger
of an old man who really meant to do the right
thing by you. Neither he nor his wife had any near
kin; there would be nobody to share with you in
case there proves to be no will at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it perfectly plain what it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
possible for me to do!&#8221; she replied with quivering
lips. &#8220;That seems to be all you have to say&mdash;and
it&#8217;s enough! I want you to leave this house, and
be quick about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Nan, you are taking this all wrong! It&#8217;s
not as though you were robbing other people: you
certainly have a better right to the money than
anybody else. Suppose that in one of his mental
lapses he had willed the greater part of his fortune
to some silly charity; all the rest of your days you&#8217;d
be sorry you hadn&#8217;t done what you could to protect
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go,&#8221; she urged in a plaintive whisper,
&#8220;so I can forget that you&#8217;ve been here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t
felt that you looked to me at least as a friend, I
shouldn&#8217;t have come. And if there&#8217;s anything to be
done it must be done quickly&mdash;that&#8217;s as plain as
daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced this in a crisp, businesslike tone,
as though there were nothing remarkable in his
suggestions. She was already wondering, as he
meant she should, whether, after all, there was
anything so enormous in the idea. Fear stole into
her heart; it would be unsafe to listen to anything
further lest he persuade her of the justice of his
plan. But he dropped the matter instantly, wisely
calculating that he had said enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Nan, that nobody is as interested
in your happiness as I am. If I didn&#8217;t care so much&mdash;if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
I didn&#8217;t hope that you cared, I shouldn&#8217;t
have come here to-night; I shouldn&#8217;t have dared!&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no response, but stared at him with
widely distended eyes. Her silence made him uneasy.
Her black gown had strangely transformed
her. She was not the Nan who had promised to
marry him&mdash;who would now, but for his folly, be
his wife. He walked to the door and then said in the
low tone he had employed from the beginning,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other things I want to speak of, but
I know this is not the time. I shall hope to see
you again soon, and please try to think better of
me, Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>She remained where she had stood throughout
the interview until she heard the iron gate click
behind him.</p>

<p>She put out the lights and climbed the stairs
slowly. The loneliness that had stifled her before
Eaton&#8217;s appearance had deepened. She passed
through the silent upper hall and locked herself
in her room, resolved not to leave it until the world
woke to life again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! No!&#8221; she moaned aloud to fortify her
resolution....</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock she was still awake, questioning,
debating with herself, while strange shadow-shapes
danced in the surrounding blackness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>NAN AGAINST NAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> Billy right, after all?</p>

<p>The question haunted her insistently. She lighted
the lamp by her bed and tried to read, but the words
were a confused jumble. She threw down her book
impatiently. If only she had kept Fanny Copeland
in the house or had given the papers hidden away
in the old table to Eaton to carry away, she would
have escaped this struggle.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were fixed upon Eaton for a time.
He had enjoined her to take a firmer hold of herself.
She readily imagined what his abhorrence
would be of the evil thing Copeland had proposed....</p>

<p>But, after all, Farley had meant to treat her
generously, as Copeland had said, and if in some
angry mood he had rewritten his will to reduce
his provision for her, there was no reason why she
shouldn&#8217;t seize an opportunity to right a wrong he
never really intended....</p>

<p>She rose, drew on her kimono, snapped on all
the lights and found that it was only half-past one.
She assured herself that she would not open the
door of Farley&#8217;s room; and yet, the thought kept
recurring that no one would ever know if she read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
those wills and destroyed them. The fear that she
might yield chilled her. She became frantic for
something to do and set herself the task of putting
the drawers of her desk in order. Some letters that
Mrs. Farley had written her while she was at boarding-school
caught her eye.</p>

<p>Yes, the Farleys had been kind, even foolishly
indulgent. She read in her foster-mother&#8217;s even,
old-fashioned hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about your money, dear. I suppose
when you go into town you see a lot of little things
that it&#8217;s nice for a girl to have. We want you to
appear well before the other girls. I&#8217;m slipping a
twenty-dollar bill into this letter just for odds and
ends. Don&#8217;t say anything to papa about it, as I
would rather he didn&#8217;t know I send you money.</p>
</div>

<p>A little later she turned up a letter of Farley&#8217;s
in which he had enclosed a fifty-dollar bill as an
addition to her regular allowance. In a characteristic
postscript he enjoined her not &#8220;to tell mamma.
She thinks you have enough money and it might
make her jealous!&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed the drawer, leaving it in worse confusion
than before. Comforts and luxuries were
dear to her. She had enjoyed hugely her years
at boarding-school. To be set adrift with a small
income while the greater part of Farley&#8217;s money
went to philanthropy&mdash;maybe Billy was right,
after all!...</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>Two o&#8217;clock. She was in Farley&#8217;s room, crouched
in a low rocker with her arms flung across the table
in which the papers were hidden. Her heart beat
furiously, and her breath came in quick gasps. She
had decided now to read the wills; it would do no
harm to have a look at them. If everything was
to be taken away from her, she might as well know
the worst and prepare for it.</p>

<p>Her fingers sought the catch that released the
spring; the top turned easily. The papers lay as
she had left them the night Farley died. She folded
the open ones and thrust them into their envelopes.
She counted them deliberately; there were six,
including the one that had fallen from the dressing-gown,
which she identified by the crosses on the
envelope....</p>

<p>If there should be no will, Copeland had said,
all the property would go to her as the only heir.
There was a grate in the room with the fuel all
ready for lighting. It would be a simple matter to
destroy all the wills. She could explain the burnt-out
fire to the maid by saying that the house had
grown cold in the night and that she had gone into
Farley&#8217;s room to warm herself. She was surprised
to find how readily explanations covering every
point occurred to her. The very ease with which
she thought of them appalled her. No doubt it was
in this fashion that hardened criminals planned
their defense....</p>

<p>She struck a match and touched it to the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
under the kindling. The fire blazed brightly. She
was really chilled and the warmth was grateful.
As she held her hands to the flames she surveyed
the trifles on the mantel and her gaze wandered
to a portrait of Mrs. Farley which had been done
from photographs by a local artist after her death.
The memory of her foster-mother&#8217;s simple kindliness
and gentleness gave her a pang. She turned
slowly until her eyes rested upon the bed in which
Farley had suffered so long. She went back to the
beginning and argued the whole matter over again.</p>

<p>As at other times, in moods of depression, she
thought of the squalor of her childhood; of her
father, Dan Corrigan, trapper, fisherman, loafer,
brutal drunkard. She gazed at her white, slim fingers
and recalled her mother&#8217;s swollen, red hands
as she had bent for hours every day over the wash-tub.
Her mother had been at least an honest woman,
who had addressed herself uncomplainingly to the
business of maintaining a home for her children.</p>

<p>All that the Farleys had done in changing her
environment to one of comfort and decency and
educating her in a fashionable school with the daughters
of gentlefolk had not affected the blood in her.
She had not been worthy of their pity, their generosity,
their confidence. Yet it had meant much to
these people in their childlessness to take her into
their hearts and give her their name. Farley&#8217;s ideas
of honor had been the strictest; the newspapers
in their accounts of his career had laid stress on this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
And how he would hate an act such as she meditated,
that would prove her low origin, stamp her
as the daughter of a degenerate!...</p>

<p>Still, there was no reason why she shouldn&#8217;t
read the wills. She returned to the table, drew one
of them out, played with it for a moment uncertainly,
then thrust it back.</p>

<p>It was Nan against Nan through the dark watches
of the night. If she yielded now she would never
tread firm ground again. Once this trial was over,
she would be a different woman&mdash;better or
worse; and she must reach a decision unaided. She
buried her face in her arms to shut out the light
and wept bitterly in despair of her weakness....</p>

<p>Four o&#8217;clock. A sparrow cheeped sleepily in the
vines on the wall outside the window. Farley had
liked the sparrows and refused to have them molested.
They were &#8220;company,&#8221; he said, and he
used to keep crumbs of bread and cake for them....</p>

<p>She lifted her head, and confidence stole into her
heart. She had not done the evil thing; she had
not even looked at the sheets of paper that recorded
Farley&#8217;s wavering, shifting faith in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it? You are a coward; you
are afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice sank to a whisper as she kept repeating
these taunts. Then she was silent for a time, sitting
with arms folded, her eyes bent unseeingly
upon the envelopes before her. There could be no
happiness in store for her if she yielded. She saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
herself carrying through life the memory of a lawless
act dictated by selfishness and greed. Suddenly
she rose and walked to the bed; and her voice
rang out with a note of triumph, there in the room
where Farley had died:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not done it; I will not do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of her voice alarmed her, and she
glanced nervously over her shoulder. Then she
laughed, struck by the thought that if Farley&#8217;s
spirit lurked there expecting to see her yield, it
was a disappointed ghost!</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly little fool,&#8221; he had often said to her
in his anger. Well, she was not so wicked as he
had believed; but she thought of him now without
bitterness.</p>

<p>Wings fluttered; the sparrows began a persistent
twitter.</p>

<p>Light was creeping in under the shades. She returned
to the table, stared at it, frowning, drew
away quickly, ran to the door, and glanced back
breathlessly. She walked back slowly, turned the
papers over, peered into the drawer to make sure
that she had overlooked nothing.</p>

<p>She took up the wills that recorded Timothy Farley&#8217;s
doubts and uncertainties and wavering generosities,
dropped them into the little well in the table
and drew the top into place.</p>

<p>A feeling of exaltation possessed her as she heard
the click of the spring. This, perhaps, was the reward
of righteousness. &#8220;We&#8217;re all happier,&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
simple-hearted Mrs. Farley used to say, &#8220;when
we&#8217;re good!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood very still for a minute, stifling her last
regret. Then she turned to the window and opened
it, unfastened the shutters, and thrust her hands
out into the gray light. A farmer&#8217;s wagon, bound
for market, passed slowly by, the driver asleep with
a lighted lantern on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>She remained there for a quarter of an hour listening
to the first tentative sounds of the new day.
The newspaper carrier threw the morning paper
against the door beneath the window, unconscious
that she saw him. She closed the window, crept
back to her room and threw herself exhausted on
her bed....</p>

<p>Outside Farley&#8217;s windows the sparrows chirruped
impatiently for crumbs from the hand that
would feed them no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>NOT ACCORDING TO LAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> was reading the newspaper report of Eaton&#8217;s
speech over her coffee when at nine o&#8217;clock he called
her on the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your speech sounds fine, though I don&#8217;t understand
all the jokes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m sure you
made a hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so sure of it myself, Nan. But please listen
to me carefully. Our friend from the southern part
of the State is here. I have him marked at his hotel.
He has probably come to see you. Let him say all
he has on his mind, then report to me. You will
probably hear from Thurston, too, during the day.
He&#8217;s trying a case this morning. But our brother
from the South comes first. Don&#8217;t let him frighten
you; just listen and encourage him if necessary to
show what he&#8217;s up to this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she replied, though the thought of
facing Harlowe alone filled her with misgivings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland was on the wire immediately
afterward, to ask if she could be of any service.
Then Thurston&#8217;s clerk called her to make an appointment
for three o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>The night&#8217;s vigil had left its marks upon her.
She was nervously alert for the day&#8217;s developments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
but nothing could be worse than the long struggle
against temptation. She had, she fancied, considered
every possibility as to the future and she was
prepared for anything that might befall her. She
was happy in the thought that she faced the world
with a clean conscience; never in her life had she
been on so good terms with herself.</p>

<p>She was standing at the parlor window when at
eleven a familiar figure entered the gate. Harlowe,
tall, slightly stooped, advanced to the door. She
called to the maid not to trouble to answer the ring
and let the man in herself.</p>

<p>He began with formal condolences on what he
called &#8220;her irreparable loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much as we may be prepared for the death of
a loved one, it always comes with a shock. I sympathize
with you very deeply, Miss Farley.&#8221;</p>

<p>She murmured her thanks and bade him be seated.
She wished she had asked Eaton to be present at
the interview, which he had forecast with a prescience
that justified all her faith in his unusual
powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came as quickly as possible after hearing of
Mr. Farley&#8217;s death, in the hope of being of some
service to you&mdash;of avoiding any difficulties that
might possibly arise with reference to the settlement
of Mr. Farley&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, and remembering Eaton&#8217;s injunction,
gave him strict attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that my handling of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
very distressing and delicate matter that brought
me here last June won your confidence to such an
extent&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, watching her narrowly for any sign
of dissent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciated that, Mr. Harlowe; it was very
considerate of you to come to me as you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t report on that case further, feeling
that it might embarrass you, assuming that the
whole matter was strictly between ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was distressed that after all our interest, and
your own generosity, we could not save your unfortunate
brother. Still, it&#8217;s something that we were
able to secure what was a light sentence&mdash;taking
everything into consideration. Only circumstantial
evidence, to be sure, but it pointed very strongly
to his guilt. You doubtless read the result in the
papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I followed the case,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m sure you did the best you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>His solemnity would have been amusing at any
other time. He clearly had no idea that she had
learned of his duplicity in taking money from her
for the defense of a Corrigan who was in no manner
related to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assume,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that no steps have yet
been taken to offer for probate any will Mr. Farley
may have left. I had hoped to see you first; this
accounts for my visit to-day. I thought it best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
to see you before going to Mr. Thurston. Mr.
Joseph C. Thurston was, I believe, Mr. Farley&#8217;s
attorney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was one of papa&#8217;s best friends and he
had charge of his affairs as far back as I can remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent man. There&#8217;s no better lawyer
in the State,&#8221; Harlowe responded heartily. &#8220;But
I occasionally find it best to deal directly with a
client. We lawyers, you know, are sometimes unwisely
obstinate, and lead our clients into unnecessary
trouble. As you are the person chiefly concerned
in this matter, I came directly to you. I did
this because in that former matter you were so
quick to see the justice of my&mdash;er&mdash;request.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her amazement at his effrontery almost equalled
her curiosity as to what lay behind his deliberate
approaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is generally known that Mr. Farley was a
man of violent temper,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Some of his
old friends on the river remember him well, and
you may never have known&mdash;and I am sorry
to be obliged to mention so unpleasant a fact&mdash;that
his mother died insane. That is a matter of
record, of course. The malady from which Mr. Farley
suffered for many years is one that frequently
affects the mind. No doubt living with him here, as
you did, you noticed at times that he behaved
oddly&mdash;didn&#8217;t conduct himself quite normally?&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering Eaton&#8217;s instructions she acquiesced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
without offering any comment. His designs,
she now assumed, were not personal to herself,
but directed against Farley&#8217;s estate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I represent two cousins of Mr. Farley&#8217;s who live
in my county. Very worthy men they are; you may
have heard Mr. Farley speak of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I knew about them. I sent them telegrams
advising them of his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very thoughtful on your part, Miss
Farley, and they appreciate it. But by reason of
their poverty they were unable to attend the funeral.
They asked me to thank you for thinking of them.
Several times during the past twenty years Mr.
Farley had advanced them small sums of money&mdash;an
indication of his kindly feeling toward them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know of that; but it was like papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In case Mr. Farley left a will, it is my duty to
inform you, that you may have time for reflection
before taking up the matter with Mr. Thurston, that
we are prepared to attack it on the ground of Mr.
Farley&#8217;s mental unsoundness. I assume, of course,
that Mr. Farley made a handsome provision for
you, but quite possibly he overlooked the natural
expectations of his own kinsfolk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She merely nodded, thinking it unnecessary to
impart information while he continued to show his
hand so openly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have probably understood, Miss Farley,
that in case your foster-father died intestate, that
is to say, without leaving a will in proper form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
you would, as his heir, be entitled to the whole
of his property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I think I have heard that,&#8221; she answered
uneasily.</p>

<p>The cold-blooded fashion in which he had stated
his purpose to contest the will on the ground of
Farley&#8217;s insanity had shocked her. Copeland had
suggested the same thing, but it was a preposterous
pretension that Timothy Farley&#8217;s mind had been
affected by his long illness. Even the assertion that
his mother had been a victim of mental disorder,
plausibly as he had stated it, would hardly stand
against the fact that Farley&#8217;s faculties to the very
end had been unusually clear and alert.</p>

<p>&#8220;In case there should be no will,&#8221; Harlowe continued,
&#8220;your rights would rest, of course, upon
your adoption. It would have to be proved that
it was done in accordance with law. The statutes
are specific as to the requirements. I&#8217;m sorry, very
sorry indeed, my dear Miss Farley, that in your case
the law was not strictly complied with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean; I don&#8217;t understand
you!&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be alarmed,&#8221; he went on, with a
reassuring smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that everything can
be arranged satisfactorily; I am not here to threaten
you&mdash;please remember that; I merely want you
to understand my case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my father never dreamed of anything of
that kind,&#8221; she gasped; &#8220;it&#8217;s impossible&mdash;why, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
would never have made a mistake in so serious a
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we are all liable to err, Miss
Farley,&#8221; he answered, with a grotesque affectation
of benevolence. &#8220;And I regret to say that in this
case the error is undeniable. What Mr. Farley&#8217;s intentions
were is one thing; what was actually done
to make you his child in law is another. We need
not go into that. It is a legal question that Mr.
Thurston will understand readily; the more so,
perhaps,&#8221; he added with faint irony, &#8220;because he
was not himself guilty of the error, not being Mr.
Farley&#8217;s attorney at the time the adoption was
attempted.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room swayed and she grasped the arms of
her chair to steady herself. The man&#8217;s story was
plausible, and he spoke with an easy confidence.
All Farley&#8217;s deliberation about the disposal of his
property would go for naught; her victory over the
temptation to destroy his wills had been futile!</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me, Miss Farley,&#8221;
the man was saying. &#8220;My clients have no wish to
deprive you wholly of participation in the estate.
And we should deplore litigation. In coming to
you now, I merely wish to prepare you, so that you
may consider the case in all its aspects before taking
it up with your lawyer. No doubt a satisfactory
settlement can be arranged, without going into
court. I believe that is all. Henceforth I can&#8217;t with
propriety deal directly with you, but must meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
your counsel. I assume, however, that he will not
wholly ignore your natural wish to&mdash;er&mdash;arrange
a settlement satisfactory to all parties.&#8221;...</p>

<p>The door had hardly closed upon him before she
was at the telephone calling Eaton, and in half an
hour he was at the house. Harlowe&#8217;s words had so
bitten into her memory that she was able to repeat
them almost <i>verbatim</i>. Eaton listened with his usual
composure. It might have seemed from his manner
that he was more interested in Nan herself than in
her recital. She betrayed no excitement, but described
the interview colorlessly as though speaking
of matters that did not wholly concern her. When
she concluded Eaton chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking it nobly,&#8221; were his first words;
&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you! You see, I had expected
something of the sort&mdash;prepared for it, in fact,
right after this fellow got that thousand dollars out
of you. He&#8217;s crafty, shrewd, unscrupulous. But
you have nothing to worry over. He came to you
first and at the earliest possible moment in the hope
of frightening you as he did before, hoping that
you&#8217;d persuade Thurston to settle with him. As
for Farley&#8217;s incompetence to make a will, that&#8217;s
all rubbish! His mother suffered from senile dementia&mdash;no
symptoms until she was nearly ninety.
Every business man in town would laugh at the
idea that Tim Farley wasn&#8217;t sane. He was just a
little bit saner than most men. His occasional fits
of anger were only the expression of his vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
personality; wholly characteristic; nothing in that
for Harlowe to hang a case on.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this point about the adoption is more serious.
When I was down there watching Harlowe
defend the man he pretended to you&mdash;but to nobody
else&mdash;was your brother, I looked up those
adoption proceedings, out of sheer vulgar curiosity.
The law provides that adoption proceedings shall be
brought in the county where the child resides, and
that the parents appear in court and consent.
Your parents were dead, and Mr. Farley&#8217;s petition
was filed in this county after you had been a member
of his household for fully two years.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seriously debated mentioning these points
to Thurston, after my visit down there, but on
reflection decided against it. Contrary to the common
assumption the law is not an ass&mdash;not altogether!
I can&#8217;t imagine the courts countenancing
an effort to set aside this adoption on so flimsy a
pretext. Mr. Farley not only complied with the
law to the best of his belief, but let the world in
general understand that he looked on you as his
child and heir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what every one believed, of course,&#8221;
Nan murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say there&#8217;s a will,&#8221; Eaton continued.
&#8220;Thurston may have to defend that&mdash;but you may
rely on him. I have already made an appointment
to meet him at luncheon to turn over to him all my
data. I&#8217;ll say to you in all sincerity that I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
see the slightest cause for uneasiness. If there&#8217;s a
valid will, that settles the adoption line of attack,
though this man may go the length of trying to
annul it on the insanity plea, merely to tie up the
estate until you pay something to these cousins to
get rid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a will; there are a number of them, I
think,&#8221; said Nan soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Farley told you about them&mdash;let you
know what he was doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he never spoke of them, except in general
terms. I used to see him hiding them; once one
dropped out of his dressing-gown.&#8221; She hesitated;
then added quickly: &#8220;I read that one before putting
it back. I know I shouldn&#8217;t have done it, but
I did&mdash;as I&#8217;ve done a good many things these last
two years I shouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so hard on yourself! It was quite
natural for you to look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The night he died,&#8221; she went on breathlessly,
&#8220;he had been looking at a number of wills he kept
hidden in mamma&#8217;s old sewing-table. I put them
back in the drawer. I suppose Mr. Thurston will
ask for them when he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he should see all such papers. You must
tell him everything you know that relates to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost burnt them all up last night,&#8221; she
exclaimed in a strange, hard tone. &#8220;That one
I read made me angry. I thought it niggardly and
unjust. And&mdash;some one told me&#8221;&mdash;in her eagerness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
to make her confession complete she nearly
blurted out Copeland&#8217;s name&mdash;&#8220;that if there
should be no will I&#8217;d inherit everything. And last
night I fought that out. And it was a hard fight;
it was horrible! But for once in my life I got a grip
on myself. You may remember saying to me,
&#8216;Don&#8217;t wobble.&#8217; Well, I wobbled till I was dizzy&mdash;but
I wobbled right! And now that that&#8217;s over,
I believe&mdash;though I&#8217;m afraid to say it aloud&mdash;that
I&#8217;m a different sort of a girl some way. I hope
so; I mean to be very, very different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor, dear, little Nan,&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you&mdash;but not very much surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see it doesn&#8217;t count, anyhow,&#8221; she
said, smiling, pleased and touched by his praise.
&#8220;If there&#8217;s a will, it&#8217;s bad; if there isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not
to be considered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t belittle your victory by measuring it
against mere money. As for those purely business
matters, they&#8217;ll be attended to. You&#8217;re not going
to be thrown out on the world just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t cry&mdash;not now&mdash;if it came to
that! Now that I know what they mean, I think I
rather like these little wars that go on inside of us.
But I tell you it was good to see the daylight this
morning and know I could pass a mirror and not
be afraid of my own face!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather nicer that way; much nicer,&#8221; he
said, with his rare smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
this. I see that I don&#8217;t need to worry about you
any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t really been doing that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At times, at times, my dear Nan,&#8221; he said, looking
at her quizzically, &#8220;you&#8217;ve brought me to the
verge of insomnia!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>THE COPELAND-FARLEY CELLAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> twelve o&#8217;clock on the night of Nan&#8217;s prolonged
struggle, Jerry, having walked to the station
with a traveling man of his acquaintance, paused
at the door of Copeland-Farley, hesitated a moment,
and then let himself in. He whistled a
warning to the watchman, as was his habit when
making night visits to the establishment. Hearing
no response, he assumed that the man was off
on his rounds and would reach the lower floor
shortly.</p>

<p>He opened his desk and busied himself with some
memoranda he had made from the books that
afternoon. There was no denying that the house
was in a bad way; the one hundred thousand dollars
of notes carried by the Western National matured
the next day, and in addition to these obligations
the Company was seriously behind in its merchandise
accounts.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, and the watchman
made no sign. Jerry closed his desk, walked back
to the elevator-shaft, and shouted the man&#8217;s name.
From the dark recesses of the cellar came sounds
as of some one running, followed by a stumble and
fall. He called again, more loudly, but receiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
no response, he ran to the stairway, flashed on the
lights, and hurried down.</p>

<p>His suspicions were aroused at once by a heap
of refuse, surmounted by half a dozen empty boxes,
piled about the wooden framework of the elevator-shaft.</p>

<p>The room where oils, paints, ethers, acids and
other highly inflammable or explosive stock was
stored was shut off from the remainder of the cellar
by an iron door that had been pushed open. As
he darted in and turned on the lights, he heard
some one stealthily moving in the farther end of
the room.</p>

<p>Seizing a fire-extinguisher he bawled the watchman&#8217;s
name again and plunged in among the
barrels. A trail of straw indicated that the same
hand that had piled the combustibles against the
shaft had carried similar materials into the dangerous
precincts of the oil room. In a moment he
came upon a barrel of benzine surrounded with
kindling.</p>

<p>He decided against calling for help. No harm
had yet been done, and it was best to capture the
guilty person and deal with him quietly if possible.
He kicked the litter away from the barrel and
waited. In a moment a slight noise attracted his
attention, and at the same instant a shadow vanished
behind an upright cask. He waited for the
shadow to reappear, advancing cautiously down
the aisle with his eyes on the cask.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;Come out o&#8217; that!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>A foot scraped on the cement floor and definitely
marked the cask as the incendiary&#8217;s hiding-place.
He jumped upon a barrel, leaped from it to the
cask, and flung himself upon a man crouched behind
it. They went down together with Jerry&#8217;s
hand clutching the captive&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he gasped, as he found himself
gazing into Copeland&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>The breath had been knocked out of Billy and
he lay still, panting hard. His right hand clenched
a revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me that thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry wrenched it from Copeland&#8217;s convulsive
clutch, thrust it into his coat pocket, and stood
erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn&#8217; near shootin&#8217; you, Jerry,&#8221; drawled Copeland,
sitting up and passing his hand slowly across
his face; &#8220;damn&#8217; near! Gimme your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry drew him to his feet. Copeland rested
heavily on the cask and looked his employee over
with a slow, bewildered stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might &#8217;a&#8217; known I couldn&#8217;t pull &#8217;er off! Always
some damn&#8217; fool like you buttin&#8217; into my blizness.
&#8217;S <i>my</i> blizness! Goin&#8217; do what I damn&#8217; please with
<i>my</i> blizness. Burn whole damn&#8217; thing down &#8217;f want
to. I&#8217;m incenjy&mdash;what you call &#8217;m?&mdash;incenjyary,&mdash;what
you call &#8217;m&mdash;pyromaniac. Go to
jail and pen&#8217;tenshary firs&#8217; thing I know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>&#8220;Not this time,&#8221; said Jerry sternly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to take you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home? Whersh that?&#8221; asked Copeland, grinning
foolishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess a Turkish bath would be better.
Where&#8217;s Galloway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gall&#8217;way&#8217;s good fellow; reli&#8217;ble watchman.
Wife&#8217;s sick; sent him home with my comp&#8217;ments.
Told &#8217;im I&#8217;d take full reshponshibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t expect to collect the insurance on
that story, did you? You must have a low opinion
of the adjusters. I&#8217;ll fire Galloway to-morrow for
leaving you here in this shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on yer life y&#8217; won&#8217;t! Silly old man didn&#8217;t
know I wuz loaded. Came on me sud&#8217;ly&mdash;very
sud&#8217;ly. Only had slix slocktails&mdash;no; thass wrong;
thass all wrong. You know what I mean. Effect
unusual&mdash;mos&#8217; unusual. Just a few small drinks
at club. Guess I can&#8217;t carry liquor&#8217;s graceful-ly as
I used to. Billy Copeland&#8217;s no good any more.
Want lie down. Good place on floor. Nice bed
right here, Jerry. Lemme go t&#8217; sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped the edge of the cask more firmly and
bent his head to look down at the heap of straw
he had been planting round it when Amidon interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much I won&#8217;t! But before we skip I&#8217;ve
got to clean up this trash. Steady, now; come
along!&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized Copeland&#8217;s arm and forced him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
stairway, where he left him huddled on the bottom
step.</p>

<p>&#8220;No respec&#8217; for head of house; no respec&#8217; whatever,&#8221;
Copeland muttered.</p>

<p>Jerry bade him remain quiet, and began carrying
the straw and boxes back to the packing-room.
He swept the floor clean, and when he was satisfied
that no telltale trace remained he got Copeland
to the counting-room and telephoned for a taxi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to be busted to-morrow; clean smash.
You made awful mistake, Jeremiah, in not lessing&mdash;no,
not lesting me burn &#8217;er up. Insurance&#8217;d
help out consid&#8217;ble. Need new building, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we don&#8217;t need it that bad,&#8221; remarked
Jerry, rolling a cigarette. He called the police station
and asked for the loan of an officer to do
watchman duty for the remainder of the night;
and this accomplished he considered his further
duty to his befuddled employer.</p>

<p>Now that the calamity had been averted, his
anger abated. Copeland&#8217;s condition mitigated
somewhat the hideousness of the crime he was
about to commit. Only his desperate financial situation
could have prompted him to attempt to fire
the building. Jerry&#8217;s silence and unusual gravity
seemed to trouble Copeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re dis&#8217;pointed in your boss, Jeremiah.
Don&#8217; blame you. Drunken fool&mdash;damn&#8217;
fool&mdash;incenjy-ary; no end bad lot.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;Put your hat on straight and forget it,&#8221; remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>He telephoned to Gaylord, an athletic trainer who
conducted a Turkish bath, and told him to prepare
for a customer. He knew Gaylord well, and when
they reached his place Jerry bade him stew the
gin out of Copeland and be sure to have him ready
for business in the morning. While Copeland was
in the bath, Jerry tried all the apparatus in the
gymnasium and relieved his feelings by putting on
the gloves with Gaylord&#8217;s assistant. After all the
arts of the establishment had been exercised upon
Copeland and he was disposed of for the night,
Jerry went to bed....</p>

<p>In the morning Gaylord put the finishing touches
on his patient and turned him out as good as new.
It had occurred to Amidon that Copeland might
decide to avoid the store that day. He was relieved
when he announced, after they had shared Gaylord&#8217;s
breakfast, that he would walk to the office
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll give the boys a jar by showing up
early,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>It was a clear, bracing morning, and Copeland
set a brisk pace. He was stubbornly silent and
made no reference to the night&#8217;s affair until they
reached the heart of the city. Then he stopped suddenly
and laid his hand on Jerry&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerry, I never meant to do that; for God&#8217;s sake,
don&#8217;t believe I did!&#8221; he broke out hoarsely. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
was troubled about the business, and some other
things had worried me lately. I took too many
drinks&mdash;and I&#8217;d never meant to drink again! I
wouldn&#8217;t have tried that sober&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t have
had the nerve!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the drink, of course,&#8221; Jerry assented.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all over now. You&#8217;d better forget it; I&#8217;m
going to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to God I could forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland shrugged his shoulders impatiently,
then drew himself erect and walked on more quickly.
Jerry cheerfully changed the subject, and when they
were near the store dived into an alley that led to
the rear door of Copeland-Farley to avoid appearing
before the clerks in Copeland&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>Copeland remained in his room all morning,
summoning the auditor from time to time to ask
for various data. He called Jerry once and bade
him make every effort to find Kinney by telephone.
Kinney was in New York; had been there for a
week. Copeland smiled sardonically at this news.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I knew he&#8217;d been away, but the fool
said he&#8217;d be back to-day,&#8221; he said spitefully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock he put a bundle of papers into his
pocket and walked toward the Western National.
The bookkeepers exchanged meaningful glances
and Jerry imagined that even the truckmen loading
freight appeared depressed. Copeland&#8217;s desperation
had been expressed vividly enough in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
drunken attempt to burn the store. And now, if
the Western National refused to extend his loans,
Copeland-Farley might cease to exist. Jerry&#8217;s
usual nonchalance left him. He failed to seize a
chance to &#8220;land&#8221; on a drummer from a New York
perfumery house who was teasing him for the
latest news of Main Street....</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock Eaton called Jerry on the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Copeland; please call me the
minute he comes in,&#8221; said the lawyer.</p>

<p>Shortly before four Copeland came back and
walked directly to his office. There was another
exchange of glances along the accountants&#8217; desks,
where the clerks bent with affected diligence over
their books.</p>

<p>The auditor was summoned again, carried a
book into Copeland&#8217;s room, and reappeared instantly.
The air was tense. It was a source of relief
to Jerry to hear Eaton&#8217;s voice as he reported
Copeland&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him,&#8221; said the lawyer, with his usual
calmness; &#8220;and don&#8217;t let him leave the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Jerry nervously watched the door for Eaton&#8217;s
appearance, Louis M. Eichberg, of Corbin &amp; Eichberg,
entered and asked for Copeland. The bookkeepers
exchanged glances again and bent over
their ledgers with renewed zeal. The door of the
private office closed upon Eichberg. It snapped
shut sharply&mdash;ominously, Jerry thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>A SOLVENT HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I&#8217;ve</span> bought in your stock,&#8221; Eichberg was saying
to Copeland. &#8220;You put up fourteen hundred
and eighty-five shares with the Western National
and I&#8217;ve bought &#8217;em in at private sale under your
collateral agreement. As I understand it there are
fifteen shares held by employees to qualify as directors.
I guess there won&#8217;t be any trouble about
them, and we&#8217;ll let &#8217;em stand for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those men paid for their stock and you have
no right to touch it,&#8221; said Copeland. &#8220;The stock
in this company has an actual value of two hundred
dollars a share&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish! Your capital&#8217;s shrunk till you can&#8217;t
see it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it! The house was never as
sound as it is to-day. I hope you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
going to stand by and let the Western sell me out
on a small loan in this high-handed fashion! It&#8217;s a
frame-up, a conspiracy to clean me out. I&#8217;ve still
got a majority of the stock, and I&#8217;ll give you a run
for your money before you get through with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your temper, Copeland! I don&#8217;t like
doing this, but it&#8217;s better for me to have the business
than to let it peter out, the way it&#8217;s doing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
I&#8217;ll even say that after we consolidate I&#8217;ll be glad
to make a place for you in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t trouble!&#8221; returned Copeland
hotly. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get rid of me so easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! Just how much stock do you think
you&#8217;ve got?&#8221; asked Eichberg with a faint ironic
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got fifteen hundred shares; the bank understood
that when I refused their demand for a majority,&#8221;
Copeland replied, frowning over the stock-ledger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows how much you know about your
own business! There&#8217;s twenty shares out of your
half that I&#8217;ve been trying to lay my hands on for
two months. It was a deal Farley made the last
year he was down here with a Fort Wayne jobber
named Reynolds that he bought out after your
father died. I know because we tried to buy up
Reynolds ourselves, but old Uncle Tim went us
one better. There wasn&#8217;t much to the business,
but the good-will was worth something and Farley
let Reynolds have twenty shares just to beat us out
of the sale. Farley had sense! When Reynolds died
his executor sold the stock to somebody here. Foreman
handled it, but he won&#8217;t tell me who he sold
to. I know you didn&#8217;t get it! Foreman says he spent
a month last summer lookin&#8217; for you to give you a
chance to buy the stock, but he couldn&#8217;t get hold
of you. You were always off sportin&#8217; with Kinney!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland had forgotten about the Reynolds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
shares. He mentally cursed Farley for not reminding
him of them; Farley had never dealt squarely
with him! Very likely he had personally told Eichberg
and the Western National of the Reynolds
shares. It was galling to be obliged to learn from
Eichberg things he should have known himself. He
had flattered himself that in persuading the bank
to accept fourteen hundred and eighty-five shares
as collateral instead of the majority for which demand
had been made at first, he had shown his
business sagacity; but evidently Eichberg had
known of the Reynolds shares all along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend that what&#8217;s left of this business
shall go to the bad,&#8221; said Eichberg. &#8220;Either you
come to terms, and let &#8217;em know outside that
we&#8217;ve arranged a merger in a friendly way, or I&#8217;ll
call up my lawyer and tell him to apply for a receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside, the interested and anxious clerks and
stenographers, cold with excitement, watched their
associate, Mr. Jeremiah Amidon, who was inviting
the wrath of the gods by knocking upon Copeland&#8217;s
door. When he entered in response to an angry
bellow, they expected to see him reappear instantly,
possibly at the end of William B. Copeland&#8217;s foot.
To their chagrin Amidon remained in the private
office for some time; and they judged from the sudden
quiet that followed his disappearance that he
was exerting a calming influence upon Copeland
and his visitor....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; Jerry remarked while Copeland
and Eichberg glared at him.</p>

<p>To Copeland the sight of Jerry was an unwelcome
reminder of the previous night. His remorse over
his effort to burn the store vanished; if it hadn&#8217;t
been for this meddlesome cub he wouldn&#8217;t now
be entertaining Eichberg in his office!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what does the boy want?&#8221; demanded
Eichberg, when Copeland found it impossible to
express his wrath at Jerry&#8217;s intrusion.</p>

<p>Eichberg knew Jerry perfectly well; everybody
in the street knew Jerry! And it was the basest
insult to refer to him as the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Mr. Eichberg! I just wanted to
hand a memorandum to Mr. Copeland.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket the certificate he had
purchased from Foreman, and handed it to Copeland,
who snatched it from him with an angry
snarl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get this?&#8221; he asked faintly after
a glance at the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it just blew in my way early in the fall. I
never bothered to get a new certificate, but I&#8217;ll
turn it in right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled out a fountain pen, removed the cap
deliberately, and wrote his name in the blank space
above the executor&#8217;s endorsement. This done, he
brushed an imaginary speck from his cuff, as he
had seen Eaton do, and went out, closing the door
softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s the answer, Eichberg,&#8221; said Copeland,
with affected nonchalance; &#8220;here are those
Reynolds shares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did that damn&#8217; little fool get this?&#8221; demanded
Eichberg, after a careful scrutiny of the
certificate and endorsements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a useful little damn&#8217; fool! He&#8217;s always
picking up something,&#8221; replied Copeland coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it was all set up,&#8221; Eichberg sneered.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come right out and say you had
that stock, and save my time? It&#8217;s worth something
if yours ain&#8217;t! You&#8217;ll either sell me that stock
or I&#8217;ll have the court throw you out. It&#8217;s up to
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you the truth about these shares,&#8221; said
Copeland, whose good humor was returning. &#8220;I&#8217;m
ashamed to say I&#8217;d clean forgotten them; but you
see stock never figured much in our corporation;
it&#8217;s always been a sort of family affair. I have
no idea where Amidon got Reynolds&#8217;s shares&mdash;that&#8217;s
straight! He&#8217;s always doing something he
isn&#8217;t paid for. And you see it isn&#8217;t quite so easy
to clean me out. But I take off my hat to you;
you&#8217;re a business man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hope had risen in him. In spite of his futile efforts
to tide over the crisis there was still the remote
chance that Kinney, who always seemed able to
borrow all he wanted for his own purposes, might
extend a helping hand. His change of manner had
its effect on Eichberg.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;The stock doesn&#8217;t cut any ice,&#8221; he fumed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to have a hundred thousand dollars
in a concern that&#8217;s losin&#8217; money like this one!
That statement you showed the bank was rotten!
You ain&#8217;t got any credit; and you know mighty well
you can&#8217;t go on here. You&#8217;ll either come to terms
or I&#8217;ll get a receiver to-morrow. That&#8217;s all there
is of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>He clapped on his hat and turned to the door
just as it opened upon Eaton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look in again in the morning, Copeland,&#8221;
said Eichberg in a loud tone. &#8220;You just think over
that matter, and I guess you&#8217;ll see it my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never put off till to-morrow what you can do
to-day,&#8221; remarked Eaton, projecting himself into
the office. &#8220;I&#8217;ll close the door if you don&#8217;t mind,
Copeland. And, Mr. Eichberg, please wait a
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re his lawyer, you don&#8217;t want me here.
I&#8217;ve said all I&#8217;ve got to say to Copeland,&#8221; Eichberg
answered. But he waited, glowering at Eaton,
who removed his overcoat, placed it carefully on a
chair, and began drawing off his gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Eichberg, they told me a moment ago at
the Western National that certain stock held as
collateral for maturing Copeland-Farley notes had
been bought by you. Is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct! I guess it was all regular,&#8221;
Eichberg snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come to that presently. You have now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
in your possession through that purchase fourteen
hundred and eighty-five shares of stock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; ejaculated Eichberg loudly.</p>

<p>Eaton raised his hand, glanced intently at the
palm, and then, with one of his familiar tricks,
bent his gaze directly upon Eichberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being a competitor of Copeland-Farley and a
director of the bank, you have naturally&mdash;quite
naturally&mdash;thought it would be a good investment
to own a large block of the stock? And it
undoubtedly occurred to you that a combination
of Copeland-Farley with Corbin &amp; Eichberg would
be highly advantageous? In fact, you thought you
had more stock than Copeland owns, and that you
could come in here and discharge him like a drayman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business! You haven&#8217;t explained
yet how you come to be buttin&#8217; in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently&mdash;presently!&#8221; replied Eaton soothingly.</p>

<p>His calm demeanor and refusal to lift his voice
further infuriated Eichberg, who breathed hard for
a moment, then pointed a stubby forefinger at the
lawyer as his wrath found utterance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Copeland-Farley&#8217;s ruined&mdash;busted! If you&#8217;ll
take a look at their last statement you&#8217;ll see they
can&#8217;t pull out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You anticipate me,&#8221; replied Eaton gently.
&#8220;The fact is I had meant to buy that stock myself,
but the bank&#8217;s haste to turn it over to you has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
spoiled that. I was annoyed&mdash;greatly annoyed&mdash;when
I found awhile ago that the stock had been
sold&mdash;sold, in violation of the stipulation&mdash;on the
bank&#8217;s usual form&mdash;that three days&#8217; grace were
to be given to the debtor to release his collateral.
I don&#8217;t believe the Comptroller would like that. I
shall consider seriously bringing it to his attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good would three days have done him?&#8221;
cried Eichberg. &#8220;The sooner he&#8217;s put out the
better. His accounts payable are goin&#8217; to bring
his general creditors down on him in a few days!
Don&#8217;t you suppose I know? Haven&#8217;t they been
telegraphin&#8217; me from all over the country for
months askin&#8217; about this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, of course,&#8221; said Eaton softly, &#8220;you did
all you could to protect your competitor&mdash;neighborly
feeling, and that sort of thing. Well, it will
be a great relief to you to know that those accounts
will be paid to-morrow&mdash;just as soon as the exchange
window of your piratical bank is opened.
There&#8217;s a hundred thousand dollars to the credit
of Copeland-Farley over there right now. I know,
because I went in a quarter of an hour ago and
made the deposit. This house is solvent&mdash;absolutely
solvent. Moreover, Copeland&#8217;s stock in the
Kinney Ivory Cement Company is now marketable.
I take some pride in that fact myself&mdash;immodestly,
I dare say, and yet&mdash;I am only human!&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a telegram from his waistcoat pocket
and handed it to Copeland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>&#8220;That patent case was decided to-day&mdash;in favor
of Kinney. Copeland, I congratulate you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland read the message, and looked dully
from Eaton to Eichberg. He was roused by Eichberg,
who had no difficulty in expressing his emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool,&#8221; he shouted, shaking his fist in
Eaton&#8217;s face. &#8220;If you&#8217;re tellin&#8217; the truth, what do
you mean to do about my stock?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton was drawing on his gloves without haste.
His face expressed the mildest surprise at Eichberg&#8217;s
perturbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Eichberg, you were in such a rush
to buy the Western&#8217;s collateral that I&#8217;m surprised
that you should trouble me&mdash;a casual acquaintance&mdash;with
such a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cheat; it&#8217;s a swindle! If there&#8217;s any law
for this&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung out of the office and tramped heavily
to the front door, while the clerks, worn with the
many agitations of the day, stared after him
mutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the morning,&#8221; Eaton was saying to Copeland,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have fuller details of the decision, but
there&#8217;s no doubt about it&mdash;we&#8217;ve won on every
point. Allow me to congratulate you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland half rose to take his proffered hand;
then with a groan he sank back and buried his face
in his hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>NULL AND VOID</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Those</span> documents have a familiar look,&#8221; remarked
Thurston with a smile as Nan placed the
packet of wills on the table beside him in the Farley
parlor. &#8220;Mr. Farley was hard to please; I&#8217;ve
learned a lot about will-writing just from studying
the different schemes he proposed from time to
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan described the manner in which she had found
the wills on the night of Farley&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was evidently troubled about them and got
out of bed to look them over. This one, that I found
lying open on the table, is torn across as though he
had begun to destroy it when the end came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely that was his intention,&#8221; Thurston
replied. &#8220;I had just written a new will for him,
but it wasn&#8217;t signed&mdash;not unless he executed it
that same afternoon. Perhaps you know about
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one was here, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Nan, after a
moment&#8217;s consideration. &#8220;The nurse was off duty;
she left for the evening at four o&#8217;clock, and I&#8217;m sure
the servants weren&#8217;t in his room. I carried up his
dinner tray myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly possible he had signed that last will.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
I was always present on such occasions and I got
the witnesses. When I called now and then with a
couple of his friends, or telephoned for them, there
was a will to be signed. You probably understood
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began opening the papers, glancing quickly
at the last sheet of each will, and turning them face
down on the table. The torn one he scrutinized
more carefully, and returned to it for further examination
when he had disposed of the others.
Nan watched him nervously. He was a small,
slight man of sixty, with a stiff gray mustache and
a sharp, rasping voice. It would not have been
easy to deceive Thurston if she had destroyed the
wills; she could never have gone through with it!</p>

<p>She felt that she had touched with her finger-tips
the far horizons and knew at last something of the
meaning of life. She had subjected herself to pitiless
self-analysis and stood convicted in her own
conscience of vanity, selfishness, and hardness.
The recollection of her gay adventures with the
Kinneys and her affair with Copeland had become
a hideous nightmare. Not only was she ashamed
of her dallying with Billy, but she accused herself
of having exerted a baneful influence upon him.
In all likelihood he would never have sunk so low
as to propose the destruction of Farley&#8217;s will but for
his infatuation for her.</p>

<p>Farley&#8217;s death had in itself exercised a chastening
effect upon her. She was conscious of trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
to see herself with his eyes and fortify herself with
something of the stern righteousness that made
him, in the retrospect, a noble and inspiring figure.
The upturned faces at the Settlement haunted
her; there was a work for her to do in the world
if only she could lay her hands upon it! In this
new mood the life of ease which money would secure
weighed little against self-dependence and
service. Money had ceased to be an important
integer in her calculations.</p>

<p>Having concluded his examination of the papers,
the lawyer lifted his head with an impatient jerk,
then sighed, and began smoothing the open sheets
into a neat pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those wills are worthless, Miss Farley,&mdash;not
one of them can be probated. The testator&#8217;s signatures
and the names of the witnesses have been
scratched out!&#8221;</p>

<p>In proof of his statement he extended one of the
wills, pointing to the heavy cross-crosses at the
bottom of the sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no idea when he did this&mdash;you
weren&#8217;t present, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he used to do his writing at the table
where he hid the wills. He occasionally wrote a
letter or a check there; but I never saw him open
the table. I never knew of that inner compartment
till the night he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that table very well; he had shown
me the hidden drawer and explained how to open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
it. But this is most unfortunate, deplorable! I
kept in touch with his doctor about his condition
and feared something like this might happen. And
he dreaded it himself&mdash;was afraid he might die
some time without leaving just the will he had determined
to make. I account for all the wills I
wrote for him but the last. The last time I was
here I brought a new will, which I don&#8217;t find among
these. Are you sure you haven&#8217;t overlooked it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was quite sure of it, but after she had described
in minute detail the events of the last
afternoon of Farley&#8217;s life, to confirm her statement
that no one who could have acted as witness
had visited Farley, she took the lawyer upstairs
to examine the table for himself. They broadened
the scope of the search, but without success.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the present I think it best for you not
to read those wills,&#8221; he said, when they had returned
to the parlor. &#8220;They represent Mr. Farley&#8217;s
changes of feeling in regard to many things&mdash;including
yourself. A little later I shall be glad
to submit them to you. The important thing just
now is the threat of this man Harlowe to attack
your rights under the adoption. Mr. Eaton and I
have already discussed that. Now that we&#8217;re
pretty sure there&#8217;s no will, this may give us some
trouble, but with characteristic thoroughness Mr.
Eaton has prepared for just this emergency. His
reasons for not telling me earlier about these things
are sound enough&mdash;his fear of disturbing Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Farley unnecessarily. He would undoubtedly have
wanted a proceeding brought to correct the adoption,
but that could only have advertised the error,
and Mr. Farley might have died before we finished
it. Still, if I had known I should have taken care
that he didn&#8217;t die intestate. But from what Mr.
Eaton tells me, this man is all primed to attack
any will that might have been left, on the ground
of Mr. Farley&#8217;s mental incapacity&mdash;which is ludicrous,
of course. There was never a saner man;
and yet his eccentricities might be magnified before
a jury&mdash;you never can tell. On the whole,
Mr. Eaton&#8217;s silence was justified. But our next
step must be carefully considered. In the mean
time&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paced the floor, considering means of relieving
her anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, while these things are pending we
shall arrange for your maintenance, on the old
basis, in this house. No one can pretend that Mr.
Farley didn&#8217;t have every intention of providing
for you generously. It&#8217;s only fair to tell you this,
that even when he seemed to waver at times he
never cut your legacy below a hundred thousand
dollars; and I know he regretted the comparative
meagerness of that&mdash;tripled the amount in the
very next will he made! You need have no fears,
Miss Farley,&#8221; he went on reassuringly. &#8220;But you
are entitled to your own counsel; it&#8217;s only right
that I should say this to you immediately; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
I suggest that you ask Mr. Eaton to represent you.
I hope you will confer with him at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed with old-fashioned formality. He was
more troubled than he cared to have Nan know,
and her silence disconcerted him. But her face
expressed neither disappointment nor alarm. She
stood erect by the table, an intent look in her eyes.
Not wishing to leave her weighed down by the
uncertainties of her future, he said briskly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t bother yourself about these matters,
Miss Farley. In the end you will find yourself
a rich woman. So&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand as the preliminary to a quick
exit, but she called him back. He did not like being
called back; now, he thought, there would be the
tears he dreaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;I
ought to have made it clear in the first place, but
I didn&#8217;t know just how&mdash;or when&mdash;to say it.
I can&#8217;t&mdash;I will not take any of Mr. Farley&#8217;s
money&mdash;not even if the law should give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with the mute appeal of the
deaf when they fail to catch a meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Miss Farley&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t take one cent of Mr. Farley&#8217;s money,&#8221;
Nan repeated firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t blame you for being disappointed&mdash;for
resenting what may appear to be a lack of consideration
on his part for your comfort&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that! I wouldn&#8217;t have you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
<i>that</i>! I&#8217;m sure he meant to do what was right&mdash;what
was generous! You don&#8217;t know how glad I
am that our last day together was a happy one&mdash;we
had never been on better terms. It&#8217;s not that
I have any unkind feeling toward papa; it&#8217;s all
myself. The Farleys were only too kind to me.
I went my own way and it made me selfish&mdash;and
pretty hard, too, I&#8217;m afraid. Papa knew it; and
you know yourself how little he trusted me. And
he was right about me: I didn&#8217;t deserve his confidence.
But I&#8217;m going to begin all over again, as
I couldn&#8217;t if I began fighting for this money. I can
see now that money can&#8217;t make me happy. I&#8217;m
going to work; I&#8217;m going to stop living, as I
always have, just for myself: I&#8217;m going&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to think about the rest of the folks a lot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The folks?&#8221; repeated Thurston feebly. &#8220;What
folks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, everybody! The down-and-outers&mdash;girls
like me who get a bad start or make mistakes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thurston&#8217;s brows worked convulsively. He had
been prepared for anything but this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I&mdash;do I understand you to mean that,
even if this estate could be turned over to you to-morrow,
you&#8217;d decline to receive it? It can&#8217;t be
possible&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s what I mean!&#8221; she cried eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it all out and have made up my
mind about it. I don&#8217;t want to be considered in
anything that has to do with papa&#8217;s property.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;But, my dear child, you can&#8217;t&mdash;you <i>can&#8217;t</i>
abandon your claims in any such fashion! It&#8217;s my
duty&mdash;I owe it to my friend and client to see
that his wishes are fulfilled. Why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she persisted, &#8220;between all those wills
you can&#8217;t tell what he wanted&mdash;only that I was
a great problem to him. I caused him a great deal
of unnecessary worry and heartache. I hope this
isn&#8217;t going to cause you any trouble&mdash;&#8221; And she
smiled in spite of herself at his consternation, as
indicated by the twitching of his brows. And there
<i>was</i>, she realized, something absurd to her cool statement
to a hard-headed lawyer that she renounced
claims whose validity he was in duty bound to support.
The situation was too much for him; he must
escape as quickly as possible from this young woman
who brushed away a fairly tangible fortune as a
waiter clears away bread crumbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Miss Farley&mdash;&#8221; he began; but, thinking
of nothing further to say, he backed awkwardly
into the hall.</p>

<p>She helped him into his coat and opened the
street door. He hurried off without saying good-bye,
clasping Timothy Farley&#8217;s wills tightly under
his arm.</p>

<p>A light snow was falling; Nan stood on the steps
and lifted her hot face to the fluttering flakes. She
watched Thurston until he turned the corner and
then went to the telephone.</p>

<p>In a moment she was connected with Mrs. Copeland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
at the farm. &#8220;I want a job,&#8221; she was saying
in a cheerful tone; &#8220;yes, that&#8217;s it&mdash;a chance to
work. You told me the other day you needed some
one to look after your business at the market-house.
I&#8217;m applying for the job. Oh, no! I&#8217;m not fooling;
I want that place! Well, I want to see you,
too; I&#8217;ll be out early in the morning!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>IN TRUST</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Copeland Farm Products</span>&#8221; in blue letters
against a white background swung over Nan&#8217;s
head on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings
in the city market-house. On those days she
left Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s farm at five o&#8217;clock with the
day&#8217;s offerings and by six the stand was in order.</p>

<p>An endless, jostling throng surged by, and every
sale she effected, every negotiation for the future
delivery of an order, had all the joy of an adventure.
Her immediate neighbors were a big-fisted German
gardener and a black-eyed Italian girl who sold
fruits and vegetables. When business lagged, the
German chaffed her about her wares or condoled
with her when some frugal marketer priced her
butter, sniffed, and departed. Nan commanded a
meager knowledge of Italian and flung a phrase
at her dark-eyed neighbor now and then in the
spirit of comradeship which the place encouraged.
She liked her &#8220;job.&#8221; She assured herself that she
had never had so much fun in all her life, and that
never again would she eat the bread of idleness.</p>

<p>But it had not proved so easy as she imagined
it would be to slip out of her old life into the new.
If she had left the Farley house preceded by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
brass band and had marched round the monument
and the length of Washington Street before taking
her place in the market, her flight could hardly
have attracted more attention.</p>

<p>The town buzzed. The newspapers neglected no
phase of Nan&#8217;s affairs, nor did they overlook her
as she stood behind the counter dispensing &#8220;Copeland
Farm Products.&#8221; She was surprised and vexed
by her sudden notoriety. A newspaper photographer
snapped her, in her white sweater and blue-and-white
tam o&#8217;shanter, passing eggs over the
counter. The portrait bore the caption, &#8220;Miss
Nancy Farley in a New R&ocirc;le,&#8221; and was supplemented
by text adorned with such sub-headings as
&#8220;Renounces her Fortune&#8221; and &#8220;Throws Away a
Million Dollars.&#8221; To be thus heralded was preposterous;
she had merely gone to work for reasons
that were, in any view of the matter, her own
private affair. But public sentiment was astonishingly
friendly; even those who had looked askance
at her high flights with the Kinney crowd said it
was an outrage that Farley had failed to provide
for her decently.</p>

<p>Fanny, thinking at first it was only a joke, a
flare of temperament (references to her temperament
had begun to pall upon Nan!), had welcomed
Nan to her house and given her charge of the
market-stand; but it was not without difficulty
that she persuaded the girl to occupy her guest-room
and share her meals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better scold me when I make mistakes,
for if I find I don&#8217;t suit I&#8217;ll fire myself,&#8221; Nan declared.
&#8220;And if I have to leave you, I&#8217;ll go to
clerking in a department store. I just mention this
so you won&#8217;t be too polite. This isn&#8217;t any grandstand
play, you see; I&#8217;m serious for the first time
in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certain, at any rate, that Copeland Farm
Products were sold with amazing ease. When it
became known that Nan Farley had become Mrs.
Copeland&#8217;s representative &#8220;on market,&#8221; there was
lively competition for the privilege of purchasing
those same &#8220;products.&#8221; Fanny complained ruefully
that the jellies, jams, and pickles created by the
young women in her industrial house would be exhausted
before Christmas and that nothing would
remain to sell but butter and eggs. Nan suggested
orange marmalade and a cake-baking department
to keep the girls at work during the winter, and
on the off days she set herself to planning the preparation
of these &#8220;specialties.&#8221; Mrs. Farley&#8217;s cooking
lessons had not gone for naught; Nan could
bake a cake in which there was no trace of &#8220;sadness,&#8221;
and after some experiments with jumbles
and sand-tarts she sold her first output in an hour
and opened a waiting list.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland told Eaton at the end of the second
week that she had never known the real Nan
till now. There was no questioning the girl&#8217;s sincerity;
she had cut loose from her old life, relinquished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
all hope of participating in Farley&#8217;s fortune, and
addressed herself zealously to the business of supporting
herself. She became immediately the idol of
the half-dozen young women in the old farmhouse,
who thought her an immensely &#8220;romantic&#8221; figure
and marveled at her industry and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! Give her all the room she wants,&#8221;
Eaton urged Mrs. Copeland. &#8220;She&#8217;s only finding
herself; we&#8217;ll have the Nan she was meant to be
the first thing we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know all these nice church-going
people would come to condole with me, or I&#8217;d
have left town,&#8221; Nan confided to Fanny. &#8220;These
women who wouldn&#8217;t let their daughters associate
with me a year ago can&#8217;t buy enough eggs now to
show how much they sympathize with me. If they
don&#8217;t keep away, I&#8217;m going to raise the price of
their eggs, and that will break their hearts&mdash;and
the eggs! But do you know,&#8221; she went on gravely,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been so happy in my life as I am now!
And I wouldn&#8217;t have anybody think it was out of
pique, or with any unkind feeling toward papa,&#8221;&mdash;tears
shone in her eyes as the word slipped from her
tongue,&mdash;&#8220;but I tell you nobody ever could have
made a nice, polite girl out of me. I was bound to
get into scrapes as long as I hadn&#8217;t anything really
to do but fill in time between manicuring and hair-washing
dates. There&#8217;s a whole lot in that old
saying about making a silk purse out of a sow&#8217;s
ear: it can&#8217;t be did!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>&#8220;If you talk that way,&#8221; Fanny laughed, &#8220;I shall
turn you out of my house. I don&#8217;t want you to
think I approve of what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m letting
you do it because I&#8217;m scared not to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be&mdash;for if you hadn&#8217;t taken me
in, I should have gone on the stage,&mdash;honestly, I
should,&mdash;in vaudeville, most likely, doing monologues
right between the jugglers and the trained
seals.&#8221;...</p>

<p>On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays Mr.
Jeremiah A. Amidon found it convenient to visit
the market-house as early as seven-thirty (in spite
of pressing duties at the store), to make sure,
he said, that Nan, and the farmhand who drove
her in and helped arrange the stock, had safely
passed all the railroad crossings on the way to
town. Jerry was a consoling person and unobtrusively
thoughtful and helpful. And in his way he
was almost as keen as Eaton. Jerry did not require
explanations, and nothing is so wholly satisfactory
as a friend who understands without being told.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girl, if your eggs are guaranteed under
the Pure Food Act, I&#8217;ll take one&mdash;the large size.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find the hard-boiled eggs at the lunch
counter in the next aisle, little boy,&#8221; Nan answered.
&#8220;How is John Cecil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Working himself to death. You&#8217;ve driven him
to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you two are not abusing me; how
about it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>&#8220;No; not vocally. Cecil&#8217;s shut up in his office
every night, getting ready to clean up those cousins
of Farley&#8217;s down on the river, but he doesn&#8217;t say
anything. Look here, Nan, we&#8217;ve got a line of
cold cream and other toilet marvels&mdash;stuff you
could handle here as a side line. Let us send you
up a bunch to put next to that pink jelly. It&#8217;s
high grade and we&#8217;ll make it to you at the right
price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life, Jerry. Drugs and hand-made
country butter can&#8217;t associate. You&#8217;d better run
down to your own little shop now and go to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>After his morning inspection he was likely to
reappear at lunch time, to see her for a moment
before she left for the farm; and he assisted in balancing
her cash when she confessed that it wouldn&#8217;t
&#8220;gee.&#8221; His pride in her was enormous; he was
satisfied that there was no other girl to compare
with her.</p>

<p>Jerry&#8217;s admiration was so obviously genuine and
supported by so deep an awe and reverence that
no girl could have helped liking it. And Jerry was
unfailingly amusing; his airs and graces, his attempts
to wear a little learning lightly, were wholly
transparent and invited the chaff he welcomed.
Nan&#8217;s feeling, dating from the beginning of their
acquaintance, that their common origin in the back
streets of Belleville established a tie between them
had grown steadily. In all her late perplexities
and self-questioning she had found herself wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
constantly what Jerry would say, and he had
supported her warmly in her rejection of the estate.</p>

<p>He had from the first confided his ambitions to
her and they were worthy ones. He not only meant
to get on, but he meant to overcome as far as
possible his lack of early advantages. He steadfastly
spent an hour at his Latin every night before
he went to bed, with only an occasional lift from
the busy Eaton. &#8220;As long as I&#8217;ve tackled it, I
might as well keep it up,&#8221; he remarked apologetically.
&#8220;Cecil says my English is so bad, I&#8217;d better
learn a few foreign languages to make me respectable!&#8221;</p>

<p>One noon Nan was munching an apple while
waiting for Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s man to carry out the
empty crates and boxes, when Jerry appeared,
looking unusually solemn.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with the world? You&#8217;re not out
of work, are you?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d ask me,&#8221; he replied, with mock
dejection. &#8220;The boss has been making a few
changes at the store and I&#8217;ve got a new job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better or worse?&#8221; she asked, with feigned carelessness.</p>

<p>This was the first time he had referred to Copeland
since her removal to the farm; and there
were still vast areas of ignorance and uncertainty
in his mind as to her feeling toward Copeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better for me; I don&#8217;t know about the house,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t anybody told you everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
that&#8217;s happened down our way?&#8221; He seated
himself on the counter and clasped one knee with
his gloved hands. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve reorganized; just
about everything&#8217;s changed except the sign. Boss
steady as a rock; things rather coming his way
now. You heard about Kinney Cement? There
was never any doubt about Cecil winning the
patent cases; and now the boss has sold out his
interest&mdash;quit cement for good and all; concentrating
on drugs. I guess he got a good price for
his cement stock, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited to see how she was affected by these
confidences.</p>

<p>&#8220;The drug business was in a bad way, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um, well; it did look for a few minutes as
though we mightn&#8217;t pull through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed at his lightly emphasized &#8220;we.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing now?&mdash;counting money
or running the elevator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tease me some more! Say, Nan, I&#8217;m not kidding
you. The boss made a new job for me; I&#8217;m
sales manager&mdash;going to start out with a suit-case
next week and shake hands with all our customers,
just to get in touch. Not to interfere with
our regular salesmen; oh, no! Just asking about
the babies down the line and making the lowly
retailer feel that we live only to please him. Do
you get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gleam or two. So Mr. Copeland got out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
his troubles, did he? Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear it.
He&#8217;s too good a fellow to go to the bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was spoken carelessly, but with a note of
sincerity. Her world had turned upside-down since
her last meeting with Billy. She waited for Jerry
to enlighten her further.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right now; you can bet on that; he&#8217;s
not going to fool with his luck any more. It&#8217;s
funny&#8221;&mdash;he was finding it difficult to conceal his
embarrassment in speaking of Copeland to Nan&mdash;&#8220;but
the boss and Cecil are getting chummy.
When the pinch came, Cecil was right there;
walked on to the scaffold and saved him after the
black cap had been pulled on and tied under his
chin. This is marked private&mdash;I don&#8217;t <i>know</i> anything&mdash;not
a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan nodded. She did not see very clearly what
he was driving at, but she refused to ask questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boss and Cecil are lunching together every
day now, and they spend an hour together. That
tickles me,&#8221; he ended softly. &#8220;I always wished
they&#8217;d hit it off together.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her for her approval of this new
combination, which was hardly more surprising
than his own manifestation of feeling. He evidently
derived the deepest satisfaction from the new
intimacy between Eaton and Copeland. The fleeting
tenderness and wistfulness in his candid, humorous
eyes touched her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he exclaimed cheerily, as the driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
announced that the wagon was ready, &#8220;do you
fly back to the farm, or will you join me in refreshments
at a one-arm sandwichorium? I&#8217;ve only got
twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fool you by accepting,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I
have some errands to do and can just about catch
the three o&#8217;clock interurban.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to a lunch room, where he found
seats and brought her the sandwich and coffee she
insisted was all she wanted. He was observing her
narrowly for signs of discontent, but she had never
seemed happier. He understood perfectly that she
wished her new activities to be taken as a matter
of course, and he carefully refrained from expressing
his great pride in her. As long as she continued
to countenance him, he was satisfied, and she
had shown in countless ways that she liked him
and believed in him.</p>

<p>He introduced her to a bank clerk who paused
in his hurried exit to speak to him and incidentally
to have a closer look at Nan. A girl nodded to him
across the room; he explained that she was one of
the smartest girls in town&mdash;&#8220;the whole show in
an insurance office; the members of the firm
don&#8217;t turn round unless she says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think,&#8221; Nan remarked, &#8220;I might have died
without knowing how it feels to be a poor working
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t die now that you&#8217;ve found it out!
It would be mighty lonesome on earth without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
you. Have a chocolate eclair,&#8221; he added hastily,&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;business
girl&#8217;s special.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks. If I don&#8217;t turn up to-night with
an appetite for dinner Mrs. Copeland will be scared
and send for the doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, I wish you&#8217;d casually mention me
to that gifted lady; I&#8217;d like to hop off at Stop 3
some evening without being consumed by the dog.
How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll stand for it! She&#8217;ll stand for &#8217;most
anybody who shows up with a clean face and a kind
heart. She&#8217;s an angel, Jerry. She&#8217;s the finest
woman that ever lived!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sort o&#8217; figured that out for myself, just
passing her on the boulevards. I thought I&#8217;d try
for a rise out of Cecil the other night and just
mentioned her with a gentle o. k. I&#8217;d gone up to
his office to see if I could shine his shoes or do any
little thing like that for him, and he looked at me
so long I nearly had nervous prostration, and then
he said: &#8216;My dear boy, the poverty of your vocabulary
is a constant grief to me!&#8217;&mdash;just like that.
I guess he likes her all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has a good many admirers,&#8221; Nan replied
noncommittally, as she crumpled her paper napkin.
&#8220;She can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anything Cecil wants he ought to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope&mdash;I should hate to think he
couldn&#8217;t get anything he wanted in this world,&#8221;
said Nan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Jerry had been deeply troubled at times by the
fear that his adored Cecil might be interested in
Nan, and the smile that accompanied her last remark
was the least bit ambiguous. With all his
assurance he was at heart a humble person, and
he never ceased to marvel at Nan&#8217;s tolerance of
him. It was not for him to question the ordinances
of Heaven. If Cecil and Nan&mdash;</p>

<p>Nan began drawing on her gloves. When they
reached the street she explained that she was going
to the Farley house to gather up some of her traps
that she had left behind. Fully conscious of his
sudden soberness and perhaps surmising the cause
of it, she lightened his burdened spirit by asking
him to come out soon to see her, and boarded a
street car....</p>

<p>This was her first visit &#8220;home&#8221; since she had
left the house to go to Fanny Copeland&#8217;s. In her
hurried flight she had taken only a trunk and a
suit-case, but her summer gowns and a number of
odds and ends remained to be packed and moved.</p>

<p>The colored maid, who had only vaguely grasped
the meaning of Nan&#8217;s sudden departure, admitted
her with joyous exclamations.</p>

<p>&#8220;About time yo&#8217; &#8217;s comin&#8217; back, Miss Nan.
Mistah Thu&#8217;ston came up heah and tole me and
Joshua to stay right along. I guess Mistah Fa&#8217;ley&#8217;s
been turnin&#8217; ovah in his grave &#8217;bout yo&#8217; runnin&#8217;
away. He was mighty ca&#8217;less not to fix his will
the way it ought t&#8217; been. Yo&#8217; &#8217;ll find yo&#8217; room just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
the way yo&#8217; left it. Mistah Thu&#8217;ston said fo&#8217; me
to keep things shined up just the way they always
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan explained that she had merely come to pack
her remaining things and asked Joshua to bring
up a trunk from the cellar. She filled the trunk and
added to the summer frocks articles from her desk
and other personal belongings that she wished to
keep for their various associations.</p>

<p>When she had finished, she crossed the hall to
Farley&#8217;s room, rather from force of habit than by
intention. She ran her hand across the shelves that
represented his steadfast literary preferences that
had never been altered in her recollection: &#8220;Pickwick,&#8221;
Artemus Ward; a volume of Petroleum V.
Nasby&#8217;s writings; Franklin&#8217;s &#8220;Autobiography&#8221;;
Grant&#8217;s &#8220;Memoirs&#8221;; Mark Twain, in well-worn
original first editions, including the bulky &#8220;Innocents
Abroad&#8221; and &#8220;Roughing It.&#8221; She resolved
to take the &#8220;Life on the Mississippi,&#8221; from which
she had so often read to him in his last year. She
rummaged in the closet for an album containing
crude old-fashioned likenesses of Mr. and Mrs.
Farley and a series of photographs of herself that
marked the swift-moving years from the time she
became a member of their household.</p>

<p>In a last slow survey of the room her eyes fell
upon the portrait of Mrs. Farley that had arrested
her with its kind motherly glance on the night of
her temptation. She reflected that her right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
remove anything from the house was questionable,
but she meant to ask Thurston to give her the
portrait when the house was finally disposed of.</p>

<p>As she lifted the frame and shook the wire loose
from the hook, a paper that had been thrust behind
the picture slipped over the mantel-edge with a
soft rustling and fell at her feet. She laid the portrait
on the bed and picked up the paper.</p>

<p>A glance sufficed to tell her that she had found
another of Farley&#8217;s wills&mdash;possibly the last, for
which Thurston had inquired so particularly.</p>

<p>She opened it hurriedly and glanced at the last
sheet. The spaces for the signatures of testator and
witnesses were blank. It was only worthless paper,
of no value to any one. It seemed a plausible assumption
that Farley, having decided finally that
he would have no use for the earlier wills, had
begun to destroy them after first placing the last
one behind the picture to avoid the chance of confusing
it with the others.</p>

<p>As Nan folded it, a name caught her attention
and she began to read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hereby give and bequeath to Frances Hillard
Copeland, as trustee, the sum of five hundred
thousand dollars, the same to be held by said
Frances Hillard Copeland, as such trustee, with the
following powers and for the following purposes:
... To pay to my said daughter upon her marriage
the principal of said fund, together with all accretions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
thereto; provided, however, that the marriage
of my said daughter shall be with the approval
and express consent of said Frances Hillard
Copeland....</p>
</div>

<p>The room swayed as the meaning of this proviso
sank into her whirling senses. Farley had interposed
Fanny between her and Billy&mdash;Fanny,
Billy&#8217;s former wife! The old man&#8217;s hatred of Copeland,
his warm admiration for Fanny, had thus
combined to fashion a device that was almost
malevolent in its cunning. She followed Farley&#8217;s
reasoning clearly. He had assumed that his own
feeling toward Copeland was shared by Fanny, and
that she would never consent to a marriage which,
in the vague prospect, had given him so much
concern. He had presumably promoted the friendly
relations between Fanny and her with this end in
view.</p>

<p>As the first shock of the revelation passed, Nan
laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor papa!&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>He little knew how near she had come to marrying
Billy! She gasped as it occurred to her that
Farley might have discussed the matter with Fanny
and persuaded her to accept the trust; but she
quickly decided against this. It was unlikely that
Farley had ever spoken to her about it; and it was
inconceivable that Fanny would have consented,
when the purpose was so clearly to make use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
her, as Billy&#8217;s divorced wife, to stand between
Billy and Farley&#8217;s money....</p>

<p>She told the servants she would send for her
trunk and instructed them to wrap up Mrs. Farley&#8217;s
portrait and hold it until she could ask Thurston&#8217;s
permission to remove it. She hurried to the car,
carrying the will with her. She must, of course,
show it to Thurston, but that could wait a day....</p>

<p>First she would tell Fanny! It was only fair
that Mrs. Copeland should know. Copeland had
never been mentioned in their intercourse, but she
would now confess everything that had ever passed
between her and Billy. She would not spare herself.
She should have done it earlier&mdash;before
Fanny threw the mantle of her kindness and generosity
about her.</p>

<p>For a month she had been happy in the thought
that she had escaped from all her troubles, and that
she was free of the wreckage of her old life. Now
it was necessary to readjust herself to new conditions,
and she resented the necessity that compelled
it. Her resolution to tell Fanny of this last
will and of all that lay back of it remained unshaken
as the car bore her homeward. It was the
only &#8220;square&#8221; thing to do, she repeated to herself
over and over again, as she looked out of the car
window upon the gray winter landscape.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>&#8220;I NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM!&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> they were still at dinner, Mrs. Copeland
was called to the telephone. The instrument was
in the living-room and Nan could not avoid hearing
Fanny&#8217;s share in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine&mdash;quite splendid!&#8221; And then,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad! I never can thank you! Well, of
course, no one knows. You&#8217;re quite sure? That&#8217;s
good; I might have known you&#8217;d manage it just
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence after she returned
to the table. She dropped a lump of sugar into her
coffee and watched the bubbles rise. Then she
lifted her head with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, Nancy Farley, that God has made
better men than J. C. Eaton&mdash;kinder and more
helpful men&mdash;but I&#8217;ve never known them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips twitched and there were tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s his nature to be kind and helpful,&#8221;
Nan replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never known any one like
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The nice thing about him is that he does you
a favor quite as though it were a favor to him.
He&#8217;s just done something for me that no one else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
could have done; there&#8217;s no one else I could have
asked to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lapsed into reverie, and Nan&#8217;s thoughts
ranged far. If Fanny and Eaton loved each other,
how perfect it would be! Their telephonic communications
had been frequent of late; nearly every
evening Eaton called her, as though by arrangement,
at the dinner hour. From the character of
Fanny&#8217;s responses he seemed to be reporting upon
some matter, the nature of which was not apparent,
but Fanny always came from these conferences in
good spirits.</p>

<p>While Fanny was studying the produce market
in the afternoon newspaper, Nan went upstairs to
get the will. She had set herself a disagreeable task,
but she did not falter in her determination to go
through with it. She glanced through the will
again, rehearsed the story as she meant to tell it,
and returned to the living-room, where Fanny
began reading the day&#8217;s quotations from the sheet
before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan, if eggs go much higher, we&#8217;ll be rich by
spring. I&#8217;m going to double the poultry department
next summer. They told me I couldn&#8217;t make
it pay, and now it&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve got!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan liked these quiet evenings. Sometimes the
young women from the farmhouse came in for an
hour of music, and Nan occasionally gave some of
her recitations, much to their delight. At other
times Fanny retired to her den to write letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
or post her books, leaving Nan to her own devices.</p>

<p>To-night Fanny produced some sewing and bade
Nan tell her of her day&#8217;s experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the long winter evenings out here are
not going to bore you, Nancy,&#8221; she remarked, noting
the serious look on Nan&#8217;s face. &#8220;Gracious!
What&#8217;s that you have there? It has an official look;
we&#8217;re not being sued, are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I have to tell you, Fanny.
It&#8217;s not a pleasant subject, and you&#8217;ll see in a moment
how hard it is for me to tell you. And you&#8217;ll
listen, won&#8217;t you; you&#8217;ll let me tell you everything
I have to say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Nancy!&#8221; said Fanny as Nan knelt
beside her. &#8220;I should be sorry if you couldn&#8217;t
come to me with anything! I hope nothing disagreeable
has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t pleasant. And to think I have to
spoil one of our evenings by talking of it! We&#8217;ve
had such good times here. It may be that you
won&#8217;t let me stay any longer after you know. I
should hate that; but I should understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched with a light caress a fold of Mrs.
Copeland&#8217;s gown, then withdrew her hand quickly,
and began fingering the will nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner we get through with it the better,
Nancy,&#8221; said Fanny kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when I went to the house this afternoon
I found that other will, the last one Mr. Thurston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
wrote for papa. It was stuck behind mamma&#8217;s
picture where he must have put it when he began
destroying the other wills. It isn&#8217;t signed, but,
of course, I shall have to give it to Mr. Thurston.
Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t have read it, but I
did, and I knew right away that I ought to
show it to you. I thought about it all the way
out on the car, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the best thing
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor child! I should think you&#8217;d had
enough of wills, without new ones popping out
from behind picture frames. If you&#8217;re sure you
want me to see it, I&#8217;m ready. Let me have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan passed it to her grudgingly and rose and
left the room. She waited in the dark dining-room,
watching the headlight of a trolley car as it neared
and passed in the highway below. The time seemed
endless. She heard the rustle of paper as Fanny
turned the pages. She was reading carefully, and
as time passed without any sign from her, Nan
knew that she was pondering deeply what she read.
Nan remained at the window, pressing her forehead
against the cold pane. Deep dejection settled upon
her; she had made a mistake; it had not been necessary
to make this revelation, which could only
cause her dearest friend unhappiness....</p>

<p>She felt suddenly the pressure of a warm cheek
against her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Nancy! Come back to the fire and let
us talk about it,&#8221; said Fanny in her usual cheery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
tone. &#8220;Of course, I never knew of this; never
dreamed of any such thing. It&#8217;s a strange idea; I
didn&#8217;t know such a will could be made; but if it
was done with Mr. Thurston&#8217;s counsel, it must be
all right. I should have thought, though, that they
would have asked me about it. The responsibility
is very great&mdash;too great&mdash;for any one to take.
But, of course, as the will isn&#8217;t signed, that&#8217;s the
end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan turned wonderingly, doubtful whether
Fanny had grasped the full significance of those
phrases that touched so nearly her own life.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t say anything about my giving a
bond; I might have stolen the money!&#8221; Fanny
continued lightly. &#8220;And if I didn&#8217;t like your suitors,
I might have played the r&ocirc;le of the cruel father
for twenty-five years! My! but you&#8217;ve had a
narrow escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t understand; you don&#8217;t understand!&#8221;
Nan moaned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see; don&#8217;t you
<i>know</i> what it all means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I think I do, Nancy. But we don&#8217;t need
to talk of that. It&#8217;s only so much paper, anyhow,
and we needn&#8217;t bother. The best thing to do is to
forget all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t let it go this way! You are far too
kind! I must tell you the rest of it&mdash;I must tell
you what made papa think of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should we talk of it, Nancy? It&#8217;s
plain enough, I suppose, what was in Mr. Farley&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
mind; but it&#8217;s all over now. It was just a freak&mdash;a
grim bit of irony; no doubt, if he had lived, he
would have changed his mind about it. It would
have been just as well if you hadn&#8217;t told me; it
really wasn&#8217;t necessary! I&#8217;m sorry you thought it
might make any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I had to tell you; I could never have
looked you in the face again if I hadn&#8217;t! He was
afraid&mdash;he had been afraid for more than a year
that&mdash;that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not say it; she could not bring herself
to the point of putting into words the intent of
Timothy Farley&#8217;s last will, that was to make it
impossible for her to marry this woman&#8217;s divorced
husband! The shame of it smothered her; she
wondered that she had ever had the effrontery to
eat Fanny Copeland&#8217;s bread and share her fireside.
The very calmness with which Fanny had received
the news added to her discomfort.</p>

<p>Fanny began moving about the room with her
light, graceful step, touching a book, unconsciously
straightening the flowers in a vase on the table.
Then she walked to the fire, where Nan crouched
mutely watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan, dear, do you want to marry Billy?&#8221; she
asked, bending down and resting her hands lightly
on Nan&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>No one would have known that this was the
first time her former husband had been mentioned
between them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>&#8220;No, no! That&#8217;s what makes this so hard&mdash;so
unjust!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you ever&mdash;did you ever think you
could?&#8221; Fanny asked in the same calm tone, in
which there was no hint of accusation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; there was a time, there were times&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny was about to resume her idle wandering
about the room when Nan clasped her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to tell you; I want to tell
you everything from the very beginning. Please
let me! I ought to have told you before I came
here; but I was so eager to come I didn&#8217;t think
of it; it didn&#8217;t occur to me at all! You see, if I
don&#8217;t,&mdash;if you won&#8217;t listen,&mdash;I must go away;
I can&#8217;t spend another night here. You must see
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like you&mdash;it is generous and kind, Nancy,
to want to tell me. But you don&#8217;t need to; it&#8217;s all
right; it&#8217;s not a thing that I should ever have
asked; you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew up a chair and clasped Nan&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Nan told the story; told it in all its details, from
the beginning of her acquaintance with Copeland.
She took pains to fix dates, showing that she and
Copeland were launched upon a lively flirtation
and were meeting, usually at the Kinneys&#8217;, before
there had been any hint of a possible divorce. It
had been her fault, her most grievous sin, that she
encouraged Billy&#8217;s attentions. They had tickled
her vanity. She had admired &#8220;Billy&#8221;; he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
a new type of man to her. She described her deception
of Farley as to their clandestine meetings; told
of his wrath when he learned of her disobedience;
and, coming to the frustrated elopement, she made
it clear that it was through no fault of hers that she
had not run away with Copeland and married him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all over; even if it hadn&#8217;t been for this&mdash;this
idea of papa&#8217;s to put you between us&mdash;I
should never marry Billy. No, no!&#8221; she moaned.
&#8220;I had decided that before papa died. You know,
don&#8217;t you,&#8221; she pleaded, with the tears streaming
down her cheeks, &#8220;that I wouldn&#8217;t have come
here, I couldn&#8217;t have pretended to be your friend,
if I&#8217;d ever meant to do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor Nancy; you poor, dear, little girl!&#8221;
Fanny murmured.</p>

<p>There was a far-away look in her eyes as she
slowly stroked the girl&#8217;s hair, but a smile played
about her lips. She did not speak again until Nan&#8217;s
grief had spent itself. Then she bent to the tear-wet
face and pressed her cheek against it, whispering,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little dear; you dear little Nancy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let me stay&mdash;you will let me stay,
after all that?&#8221; faltered Nan.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fine of you to tell me; you don&#8217;t know
how grateful I am&mdash;and glad. Of course, you will
stay; it would break my heart to lose you now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan drew away and looked long into the steady,
tranquil eyes. She had not been prepared for this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
It was beyond comprehension that her story could
be received with so much magnanimity, that forgiveness
could be so easily won. She caught the
hands that clasped her face and kissed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know!&#8221; she cried fearfully. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t made you understand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand it all, Nancy; I&#8217;d guessed
most of it without your telling me. And it does
make a difference; yes, it makes a very great difference.&#8221;
And then, feeling Nan&#8217;s hands relax
their tight hold, and seeing the fear in her face,
she smiled and added, &#8220;But not the difference you
think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only you don&#8217;t send me away! It was
brazen of me ever to come; I don&#8217;t know how you
came to take me without a question, when I&#8217;d
done you the greatest wrong one woman can do
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But maybe you didn&#8217;t!&#8221; said Fanny quickly,
with a wistful little smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask you
one question, Nancy,&mdash;just to be sure. But you
needn&#8217;t answer; you won&#8217;t feel you must, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything&mdash;anything!&#8221; Nan faltered.</p>

<p>Fanny turned her head, as though doubting,
questioning, and her eyes were very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Nancy, tell me this&mdash;and please be very
honest, and don&#8217;t trouble about what I may think
or feel about your answer&mdash;do you&mdash;do you love
Billy&mdash;now?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>&#8220;No; no! It was never love; it was never really
that! His attentions turned my head, and I hadn&#8217;t
the sense to keep away from him. It was all my
fault. I&#8217;m ashamed to tell you that I was very
lonely after I came home from school&mdash;it is ungrateful
to be saying it; but I have always felt
uneasy&mdash;self-conscious among the people here.
I have never got away from the feeling that whenever
they saw me they were saying, &#8216;That&#8217;s the
girl the Farleys raked out of the river and did
everything for&mdash;and just look at her!&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t
help that&mdash;the feeling that they knew I was just
a waif, a nobody. It made me rebellious and defiant.
Oh, I know it was unjustified and that it&#8217;s
unkind to speak of it even to you. And that&#8217;s why&mdash;one
reason, at least&mdash;I&#8217;ve enjoyed knowing
Jerry so much. Jerry <i>knows</i>, and he doesn&#8217;t care!
He knows every little tiny thing about me and my
people, and how poor and wretched we were! But
Billy&mdash;I haven&#8217;t any feeling about him now except&mdash;just
friendliness&mdash;and pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you something that will show
you how very dear you are to me,&#8221; said Fanny,&mdash;speaking
slowly. &#8220;I think it was this that drew me
to you&mdash;made me want to be friends with you
when Mr. Farley first brought us together. Oh,
Nan,&#8221;&mdash;her voice sank to a whisper,&mdash;&#8220;I still
love Billy! I never stopped loving him!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>COPELAND&#8217;S UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eaton</span> tore March from his office calendar,
crumpled it in his hand, and glanced out of the
window as though expecting to see April&#8217;s heralds
dancing over the roofs below. It was nearing five
o&#8217;clock and his big desk was swept clear of the
day&#8217;s encumbrances. He paced the floor slowly,
his gaze ranging the walls with their ranks of file-cases.
A particular box in the &#8220;C&#8221; section seemed
to exert a spell upon him. He glanced at it several
times, then opened a drawer in his desk, peered in,
and absently closed it. He was waiting for Copeland,
and as usual, when he expected a visitor, was
planning the interview to its minutest details.</p>

<p>Since the reorganization of the Copeland-Farley
Company he had been seeing much of Copeland.
The winter had wrought changes in Billy&mdash;changes
that at first provoked cynical comment
from persons who had no faith in his reformation.
But people were now beginning to say that they
always knew Billy had the right stuff in him. Even
the fact&mdash;which was pretty generally known&mdash;that
Billy had narrowly escaped disaster didn&#8217;t
matter particularly. Such fellows were always
lucky. If the decision in the Kinney patent case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
hadn&#8217;t come just when it did, he would have been
down and out; but it <i>had</i> come. Yes; he was a
lucky devil.</p>

<p>Eaton was breathing easier now, as days passed
and Copeland seemed to have settled into a sober
and industrious routine. He was even giving time
to broadening the scope and effectiveness of the
Bigger Business Club, and had accepted a place on
the municipal reform committee of the Chamber of
Commerce. Mr. Jeremiah A. Amidon pointed to
his boss with pride. Jerry had risen to the dignity
of a standing invitation to Sunday evening tea at
Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s and was the proudest and happiest
of Jerries.</p>

<p>Three slight snarls of a desk buzzer, marked, to
the attentive ear, by an interval between the second
and third, spelled Copeland in the office code.
Eaton raised his arm and pressed a button attached
to a swinging cord over his desk. By this
system acceptable visitors could be announced by
the girl in the reception room and disposed of at
long range. If Eaton didn&#8217;t want to be bothered,
he made no response. This was only one of his
many devices for safeguarding his time. When he
was studying a case, he ignored the presence of his
most remunerative clients on the theory that they
were unlikely to have anything of importance to
impart. It was a fair assumption that before he
undertook any case he extracted from the client&#8217;s
head and stored in a file-box all the information of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
which that particular client was possessed. Clients
resented this treatment, but as Eaton was admittedly
the best patent lawyer in three States,
they were obliged to humor him.</p>

<p>Copeland entered with a quick, springy step.
Jerry had persuaded him to spend an hour three
times a week at Gaylord&#8217;s, and as a result Copeland
was in prime condition. He nodded to Eaton
and sat down in the chair the lawyer pushed
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The state of your desk fills me with envy; I
never get mine as clean as that. If I turn my back,
somebody throws something on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my system has its disadvantages; strangers
coming in think I haven&#8217;t any business. You
wanted to speak about those notes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; they&#8217;re due to-morrow and I&#8217;m ready to
take them up. Our merchandise bills are cleaned
up, and my personal obligations are all taken care
of. Our credit&#8217;s A 1. The White River National
is taking good care of us and they&#8217;re not as fussy
as the Western was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Western isn&#8217;t a bank,&#8221; remarked Eaton;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a pawnshop with a third-degree attachment.
About the notes,&#8221; he continued, tipping himself
back in his chair and crossing his slender legs,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t have to pay them to-morrow. They
can be carried longer&mdash;indefinitely. It&#8217;s just as
you say, however. It might be best to accept an
extension of three or six months.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;No, thanks! I&#8217;ve got the money to pay, and
you may be dead sure it&#8217;s a comfortable feeling to
know I&#8217;ve got it! I hope I&#8217;ll never have to sweat as
I did for a year or two.&#8221; He frowned, and slapped
his gloves together. &#8220;Look here, Eaton, you&#8217;re the
hardest man to thank I ever saw, but for God&#8217;s
sake, don&#8217;t ever think I don&#8217;t appreciate all you&#8217;ve
done for me! You saved me&mdash;hauled me out
when I was going down for the last time! I don&#8217;t
know why you did it; there was no reason why
you or anybody else should have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not I you have to thank; it&#8217;s an enlightened
judiciary that upheld Kinney&#8217;s patents on Ivory
Cement machinery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be something in that,&#8221; Copeland
admitted, &#8220;but there are other things I want to
speak of. I insist on speaking of all of them. In
picking up that Reynolds stock as you did&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please stick to facts! It was our blithe gazelle
Amidon who did that. I honestly didn&#8217;t know it
was in existence till he came to me about it.
Thank Jerry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank him! I&#8217;m going to fire him if he doesn&#8217;t
quit working me so hard,&#8221; laughed Copeland.
&#8220;But you backed him, and advanced him the
money. The way that boy strolled in with that
certificate just as Eichberg was jamming me into
a corner is the last thing I&#8217;ll think of when I
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong sense of the dramatic, that Jerry!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
observed Eaton musingly. &#8220;Great loss to the stage,
his devotion to commerce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can sell goods, and he knows how to hypnotize
other fellows into doing it. I&#8217;m giving him all
the rope he wants. He&#8217;s the smartest youngster
on the street, and I&#8217;m proud of him. There&#8217;s
more than that; I&#8217;m going to tell you, because
you&#8217;ve been mighty good to me and I want you
to know just how desperate I was last November.
I want you to know how near bottom I&#8217;d gone.
Eaton, I tried to burn the store the night before
the Western notes came due&mdash;and I&#8217;d have done
it&mdash;I&#8217;d have done it if Jerry hadn&#8217;t stopped me!&mdash;God!&#8221;
he groaned. His frame shook with repulsion
and abhorrence and he turned his head to
avoid Eaton&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing, Copeland,&#8221; said the lawyer
quietly, &#8220;that we&#8217;re not allowed to be as bad as
we want to be in this world. No man is ever that!
That, for a lack of a better word, is my religion.
Let&#8217;s go back to the notes. You say you prefer
to pay them; but that&#8217;s wholly optional. It had
occurred to me that you might want to keep the
money in the business, and if you do it&#8217;s yours,
quite indefinitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland shook his head and drew out a check.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a big clean-up on my Cement stock
and now that I&#8217;m out of it I&#8217;m never going to
monkey on the outside again. Here you are, with
interest!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>Eaton read the check, mentally verified the
interest and opened the top drawer of his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are four notes of twenty-five thousand
each,&#8221; he remarked, as he bent over his desk and
wrote &#8220;Paid&#8221; across the four slips of paper. &#8220;They
were made to me&mdash;you remember? As I told you
at the time, I wasn&#8217;t making the advance myself,
and I deserve no thanks for negotiating the loan&mdash;none
whatever. You&#8217;re entitled to the canceled
notes, of course; but perhaps you&#8217;ll be satisfied to
let me destroy them here in your presence. The
reason for that is that I endorsed the notes to the
person who made the advance, to protect your
creditor in case of my death. That person is very
anxious not to be known in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I ought to know,&#8221; Copeland replied.
&#8220;A debt like that can&#8217;t just be passed over. I&#8217;d
be more comfortable if I knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;&#8221; began Eaton.</p>

<p>Copeland shook his head and put out his hand.</p>

<p>Eaton bent a quick, penetrating glance upon
him, then gave him the notes. Copeland&#8217;s face
went white as he read the endorsements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny!&#8221; he gasped chokingly. He bent forward
and grasped Eaton&#8217;s arm. &#8220;This is a trick;
a ghastly joke! She never would have done it; no
human being would have done this after&mdash;after&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No human being&mdash;no!&#8221; replied Eaton, swinging
round in his chair so that he did not face
Copeland for a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>Copeland&#8217;s hand shook as he looked again at
the endorsements.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Eaton, you had no right to do it! You
knew I wouldn&#8217;t have taken her help&mdash;not&mdash;after&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I knew you wouldn&#8217;t. And she knew you
wouldn&#8217;t. That, of course, is why she did it in
the way she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intentness of Copeland&#8217;s thought showed in
his face; he continued to turn over the notes in
his shaking hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will tell her how beyond any thanks
this is&mdash;beyond anything I can do or say!&#8221; He
bent his head and went on brokenly. &#8220;It would be
cruel, Eaton, if it weren&#8217;t so kind, so generous, so
merciful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you have done enough already to show
your appreciation,&#8221; replied Eaton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say to
you that you&#8217;ve done what she expected&mdash;and
what, to be frank about it, I did not expect. At
least, I wasn&#8217;t very sanguine. You&#8217;d gone pretty
far&mdash;farther than men go and come back again.
You&#8217;ve proved your mettle. If you go on as you
are, you are safe. And I&#8217;m glad&mdash;happier about
it than I&#8217;ve been about anything in a mighty long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it. I was worse than ever
you imagine. I treated her as a man doesn&#8217;t treat
his dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Eaton acquiesced, &#8220;it was all that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>&#8220;And you can see how it leaves me,&#8221; Copeland
moaned, crumpling the notes in his hand,&mdash;&#8220;with
a debt these things don&#8217;t express; a debt that can&#8217;t
be discharged!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something you can do, Copeland, if
you will. She hasn&#8217;t asked it; I have no reason to
think it has even occurred to her. It&#8217;s my own idea&mdash;absolutely&mdash;I
want you to be sure of that. It
strikes me as being only decent, only just.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; Copeland eagerly assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to speak plainly, Copeland. It&#8217;s
about Manning. You let the impression get abroad
that your wife had given you cause to doubt her
loyalty. Yes; I know all about it. Manning was
your friend, not hers. The injury was not only to
her; it was to that man, too. Your use of him, to
cast suspicion on the woman you had sworn to
shield and protect, was infamous, dastardly! Manning,
I have reason to believe,&#8221;&mdash;his eyes ranged
the file-cases,&mdash;&#8220;is a gentleman, a high-minded
fellow, who admired your wife only as any friend
might be expected to admire her; but you used
him&mdash;made him an excuse to hide your own
infamy. You hadn&#8217;t the courage to bring him into
court; you merely let some of your new-found
friends whisper insinuations that were more damning
than a direct charge of infidelity. Manning
cut your acquaintance, I believe, when he found
what you had done. You owe him an apology, at
least. And if you want to act the part of a man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
you will go to Mrs. Copeland and tell her the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton&#8217;s feelings had for once got the better of
him; several times his voice betrayed deep emotion.
He turned toward his desk as the buzzer sounded
a cryptic message. He telegraphed a reply, and a
moment later the sound of steps in the corridor
was followed by the closing of a door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do it&mdash;I will do it,&#8221; said Copeland.
&#8220;As I began to get my bearings again, that thing
troubled me; it has been in my mind to speak to
you about it. God knows, I want to make reparation
for all the evil I&#8217;ve done. I was a brute, a
coarse beast. And you&#8217;re right that Manning is a
gentleman, and a mighty fine fellow&mdash;he never
was anything else! I&#8217;ll go to him and be glad to
do it. But to see Fanny&mdash;that is not so easy!
You can understand that, Eaton. I must have
time to think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it best for you to see Mrs. Copeland
first,&#8221; replied Eaton, &#8220;then Manning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland, pondering with knit brows, nodded
a reluctant acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will do as you say; but what if she&#8217;d
refuse to see me? It&#8217;s going to be mighty hard,&#8221;
he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s conceivable that she&#8217;d refuse, of course.
She never meant for you to know of her help, and
I&#8217;ve broken faith in telling you; but I&#8217;ll take the
responsibility of sending you to see her. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
made this other suggestion&mdash;about Manning&mdash;with
a feeling that sooner or later it would occur
to you. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve met me in this spirit. It
confirms my impression of you&mdash;it satisfies me
that I was right in assuming that once you got
back in the straight road you would keep to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to disappoint you, Eaton. I
don&#8217;t intend to be pointed to as a failure in this
community. The mistakes I&#8217;ve made have been
bad ones&mdash;the very worst! God knows, I&#8217;m
humble enough when I think of Fanny. It was
like her to want to save me. That&#8217;s what makes it
so hard&mdash;that it was like her to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Eaton gravely; &#8220;it was like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his overcoat from a closet and drew
it on, mused a moment, apparently absorbed in
contemplation of the interior of his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Copeland is here, waiting to see me. She
came a moment ago and is in the next room. She
had no idea, of course, that you were likely to be
here&mdash;rest assured of that. My business with her
is not so important as yours. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Copeland, startled, irresolute, followed him to
the door of a smaller room used for consultations.
Eaton opened it and stepped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be dining at the club later, if you care
to see me,&#8221; he said, and vanished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />


<small>JERRY&#8217;S DARK DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span>, who had never been ill in his life, was
now experiencing disquieting sensations which he
was convinced pointed to an early and probably
a painful death. He went about his work listlessly,
and from being the cheerfulest person in Copeland-Farley,
he became so melancholy that his fellow
employees wondered greatly and speculated in private
as to the cause of the change. Jerry encouraged
the thought of death and blithely visualized
the funeral at which Eaton&#8217;s pastor (chastely
surpliced and reinforced by a boy choir) would
officiate. He chose the rector of Christ Church
because that gentleman had not been unmindful of
his occasional attendance upon services (Jerry had
courageously repeated his first timid visit), and
had even made a memorandum of Jerry&#8217;s name and
address, with a view to calling upon him. This attention
clearly pointed to the rector as the minister
predestined from the beginning of things to
officiate at his funeral, a function about which he
meditated much in a spirit of loftiest detachment.</p>

<p>A few people would be sorry when he died, but
only a few. The boys at the store would contribute
a wreath; they had done that for a drayman who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
had succumbed to pneumonia a short time before;
and the people at his boarding-house would probably
grace the last rites with their presence. Copeland
would probably attend; he might even add
dignity to the occasion by acting as pallbearer.
One of the girl stenographers, whose lachrymose
facilities had occasionally aroused his ire, would
doubtless weep; she had cried when the drayman
died, though her acquaintance with that person
had been the most casual. Nan might attend the
funeral, but he hoped to time his passing so that
the funeral could be held on a market morning,
thus giving her a good excuse for absenting herself.
It would be a sad, pitiful funeral, with only a handful
of mourners, as his only living relative was a
cousin in Oklahoma whose exact address he had
forgotten. The brief list of mourners included the
billiard-marker at the Whitcomb. Jerry had once
lent him five dollars, which was still carried as an
open account and probably a permanent one; he
meant to leave a memorandum of general forgiveness,
including a release of the billiard-marker
from any obligation to pay the five dollars. And
he would bequeath him his best cuff-buttons to
show that he had died with no hard feelings against
him. The thought of the meager attendance and
of the general gloom of the affair gave him the
keenest satisfaction. No one would care particularly.</p>

<p>Jerry&#8217;s malady was one of the oldest that afflicts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the human race. Jerry was in love; he was in love
with Nan, though he would have stormed indignantly
at any hint of this bewildering circumstance,
this blighting, crushing fact. His first realization
that this was the cause of his trouble fell upon him
as he sat one evening in the hotel at Madison listlessly
talking to a dry-goods drummer. Jerry was
taking a run over Copeland-Farley territory to
&#8220;jolly&#8221; the trade, carrying no samples and soliciting
no orders, but presenting himself as the personal
representative of the house, bent upon strengthening
social ties only, and only casually glancing over
the shelves to see how much Copeland-Farley&#8217;s
competitors were selling. The dry-goods man,
noting Jerry&#8217;s unwonted gloom, frankly attributed
it to a love affair; and to find that his condition
was perceptible even to the eye of a dry-goods
drummer, for whose powers of discernment he had
only the mildest respect, added considerably to
Jerry&#8217;s melancholy.</p>

<p>Nan was not for him; he knew this; there had
never been any doubt in his mind that Eaton and
Nan would marry ultimately. Any speculations as
to his own part in Nan&#8217;s life, beyond the boy-and-girl
comradeship he had been enjoying, were vain
and foolish; they were even disloyal to Eaton; they
were an insult to Nan. Nan had intimated several
times that Eaton was in love with Mrs. Copeland,
but now that the black clouds had risen on his own
horizon, Jerry knew the absurdity of this. Eaton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
had appeared unusually absent-minded of late, and
this marked his friend as a man in the toils of
love. Jerry knew the symptoms! Except for a
passing attachment for a stenographer in a hardware
house, who had jilted him for a red-haired
bookkeeper, Jerry had never been in love. He had
grieved over the hardware girl&#8217;s perfidy for two,
perhaps three, days. But this was the real thing
and a very different matter; he meant to win the
martyr&#8217;s wreath by going to his death so heroically
that no one would ever know how he had suffered.</p>

<p>Returning to town Saturday evening he checked
his grip at a hotel and went to the theater, not for
pleasure, but to lose himself among strangers and
enjoy his misery. As he moodily surveyed the assembling
audience a cold hand gripped his heart.
Eaton, followed by Mrs. Copeland, Nan, and a
lady he did not know, filed down to the second row
where Eaton always sat.</p>

<p>Since Farley&#8217;s death Nan had attended no entertainments
of any kind; she had refused to accompany
Jerry to a concert only a fortnight earlier.
Her presence at the theater with Eaton confirmed
his worst suspicions. Their engagement would
doubtless be announced in a day or two; he must
steel himself against this and prepare to offer his
congratulations. The comedy presented was one
of the hits of the season, but its best lines and most
amusing situations failed to evoke a smile from
Jerry, who clutched his programme and stared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
the back of Nan&#8217;s head. Nan was enjoying herself;
from his seat on the back row he was satisfied of
that, and he assured himself that he was glad of
her happiness. At the end of the second act, he
left and went to his room to spend a wretched
night.</p>

<p>Jerry found on his desk Monday morning a note
from Eaton, written several days earlier, asking
him to join his theater party and go to the club
later for supper. His sister had come down from
Cleveland to make him a visit, Eaton explained,
and he wanted Jerry to meet her. For an instant
the world was the pleasant, cheerful place it had
been in the old days before love darkened his life.
Eaton was still his friend; but only for a moment
was the veil lifted. The clouds settled upon him
again, as he grasped the motive behind Eaton&#8217;s
friendly note&mdash;as though at any time in their
intercourse there had been the ghost of a motive
back of anything John Cecil Eaton had ever done
for him except a perfectly transparent, generous
wish to be kind to him! But the coming of the
sister (who had never, so far as Jerry knew, visited
Eaton before) could only mean that Eaton wished
to introduce Nan to her as a prospective member
of the family. And, proud of his logic, Jerry reasoned
that he was to have been given an opportunity
to offer his own congratulations.</p>

<p>For a week Jerry kept away from the market-house;
Nan knew he had been out of town, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
failing to see him, would assume that he was still
away. He could not face her; it would be a merciful
thing if he never saw her again. Eaton he would
avoid; his friend must never know of his hopeless
passion. Nan and Eaton must begin their married
life wholly ignorant that he had ever looked upon
Nan as anything more than a good friend. Phrases
out of novels he had read assisted him in the definition
of his attitude toward her and Eaton. &#8220;Unworthy
of the woman he loved,&#8221; and &#8220;climbed
slowly, painfully, to the sublime heights of a great
renunciation.&#8221; He <i>was</i> unworthy; he had known
that all along; and he would give her up to his
best friend with a beautiful magnanimity. The
fiction with which he was familiar had not lacked in
noble examples of just such splendid sacrifice. If
death failed to end his misery, he would live on,
sadly, but manfully, and on every anniversary of
their meeting on the river bank, he would send
her a rose&mdash;a single beautiful rose&mdash;always exactly
the same, and it would puzzle her greatly
and make her wonder; but she would never guess
that it was from one who had loved her in the
long ago.</p>

<p>He had made no sign to Eaton, not even to acknowledge
the theater invitation; and when one
day he ran into the lawyer in the bank lobby he
was about to pass him hurriedly when the familiar
&#8220;Ah, Jerry!&#8221; arrested him. He swallowed hard;
it was not easy to meet his friend with the air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
sweet resignation and submission to inexorable
fate that he had been cultivating.</p>

<p>&#8220;An overdraft?&#8221; Eaton suggested in his usual
tone. &#8220;Nothing else could account for your woeful
countenance! I didn&#8217;t know you were in town.
Just in, I suppose, from a flight into the remoter
recesses of the Commonwealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been back a few days,&#8221; Jerry confessed
reluctantly; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve been too busy to
come around. I meant to call you up about that
invitation; I didn&#8217;t get it until after the show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We missed you; I had wanted you to meet my
sister. In fact, I&#8217;d rather prepared her for the
meeting&mdash;led up to it, warned her of your native
flavor. She&#8217;s still with me. You&#8217;re working yourself
to death; it&#8217;s in your eye. Can&#8217;t you come up
Tuesday night and dine with us? I&#8217;ll see if we
can&#8217;t get Mrs. Copeland and Nan to come in.
They&#8217;ve been seeing something of Florence.
You&#8217;ve seen Nan&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I haven&#8217;t seen her,&#8221; Jerry replied, a little
resentfully, as though Eaton ought to know why
Nan had become invisible so far as Jeremiah
Amidon was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s another victim of overwork,&#8221; Eaton remarked
carelessly, but behind his glasses there was
a gleam of humor. &#8220;Not quarreling, I hope? I
confess that at times Nan is a trifle provoking, but
she means nothing by it. You must give the benefit
of all doubts to a girl who is just emerging from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
severe ordeal&mdash;settling herself into a new manner
of life. It&#8217;s wonderful; really amazing how she&#8217;s
coming on. We shall be dining at seven. Please
don&#8217;t make it necessary for me to explain a second
scorning of my hospitality to my sister. She&#8217;d begin
to think you a myth, like Jupiter and the rest
of the immortals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks; I&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; Jerry answered solemnly.
Then he watched Eaton&#8217;s retreating figure
shame-facedly. He was acting abominably toward
Eaton.</p>

<p>The Pembrokes had gone to Florida for the spring
months, and Eaton had taken their house that he
might indulge in a round of dinners and a ball that
proved to be the season&#8217;s smartest event. These
social activities Jerry had taken as another sign of
Eaton&#8217;s approaching marriage. And Jerry had resented,
as an attack upon his personal rights,
Eaton&#8217;s transfer from the rooms where he had
always been so accessible, to the big house where
visitors were received by the Pembrokes&#8217; butler&mdash;a
formidable person who, he fancied, regarded him
with a hostile eye.</p>

<p>Jerry presented himself at the hour appointed,
wearing the crown of his martyrdom, which, if he
had known it, was highly unbecoming. As he had
walked around the block twice to prepare himself
for the ordeal, he was late, and stood uncomfortably
in the drawing-room door, quite unnoticed, while
the sister (whose back he distrusted) finished a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
story she had been telling. But spying him, Eaton
rose and greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Florence, Mr. Amidon; my sister, Mrs. Torrington,
Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrington, a tall, dark woman in her early
thirties, graciously assured him that she had delayed
her departure from town until he could be
produced for her edification.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; missed much,&#8221; said
Jerry, hating himself at once for that unnecessary
a, from which he had honestly believed himself
permanently emancipated. He shook hands with
Mrs. Copeland and then with Nan&mdash;without
looking at her. The butler announced dinner, and
he found himself moving toward the dining-room
beside Mrs. Torrington. In her ignorance of the
darkness in which he had immersed himself, she
treated him quite as though they were in the habit
of meeting at dinners. It was to his credit that he
saw at once that she was a superior person, though
he did not know until later that, as the wife of a
distinguished engineer, she was known in many
capitals as a brilliant conversationalist, with a reputation
for meeting difficult situations. On the way
down the hall she spoke of Russia&mdash;she had been
telling a Russian story at the moment of his
appearance&mdash;and her manner expressed a flattering
assumption that he, of course, was quite
familiar with the social life of the Russian capital.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>It was the most informal of dinners; Jerry found
himself placed between Mrs. Torrington and Mrs.
Copeland, which left Nan at Eaton&#8217;s right. This
arrangement had not been premeditated, but he
saw only the darkest significance in Nan&#8217;s juxtaposition
to Eaton. She seemed unwontedly subdued,
and averted her eyes when their gaze met.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the nicest party you&#8217;ve had for me,
Cecil,&#8221; Mrs. Torrington was saying,&mdash;&#8220;cozy and
comfortable so everybody can talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry hoped they would talk! (He was watching
Mrs. Torrington guardedly to see which fork she
chose for her caviar.) Eaton was unusually grave;
Mrs. Copeland seemed preoccupied; Jerry&#8217;s heart
ached at the near presence of Nan. But at a hint
from Fanny, Mrs. Torrington returned to her experiences
abroad, and soon had them all interested
and amused. Jerry quickly fell victim to her charm;
he had never before met a woman of her distinction
and poise. Even her way of speaking was different
from anything he had been accustomed to&mdash;crisp,
fluent, musical. Her good humor was infectious
and she quickly won them all to self-forgetfulness.
Mrs. Copeland described an encounter she had
witnessed between a Russian and a Frenchman in
a Roman <i>pension</i> where she had once spent a
winter&mdash;an incident that culminated in a hasty
exchange of wine-glasses across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Jerry,&#8221; remarked Eaton casually; &#8220;that
leads us naturally to your pleasing adventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
down the road. Florence, if you urge Mr. Amidon
he will tell you of most amazing experiences he has
had right here at home in the pursuit of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrington&#8217;s fine eyes emphasized her appeal.
They would all tell of the worst food they
had ever eaten, she said; she had spent years collecting
information.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may lapse into the vernacular, Jerry,&#8221;
Eaton added encouragingly; &#8220;we will all understand
that you are falling into it merely in a spirit
of realism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is tough,&#8221; said Jerry, turning to Mrs.
Torrington. &#8220;Your brother has told me a hundred
times to cut out those stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was only after he had heard them all!
And he has been boasting that he could persuade
you to tell them to me. Please! I want to add them
to my collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you understand this isn&#8217;t my fault&mdash;&#8221;
he began....</p>

<p>They were still demanding more stories after
the dessert plates had been removed. He had so
far yielded to their friendliness that he appealed
occasionally to Nan, and finally asked her to tell
one of Farley&#8217;s stories about the river, which he
said he had forgotten. They remained at table for
their coffee to avoid disturbing the good cheer that
now prevailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Amidon is up to my highest expectations,&#8221;
Mrs. Torrington remarked when they rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
stay another week if you&#8217;ll give just this same
party again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve missed you at the farm,&#8221; said Mrs.
Copeland, as Jerry seated himself beside her in the
library. &#8220;And I was just beginning to feel that
we were acquainted! But, of course, you&#8217;ve been
away. I heard that from Mr. Copeland.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she mentioned Copeland, she smiled gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have been away, and we&#8217;re busier than
usual just now,&#8221; he replied, realizing that something
had happened in her relations with Copeland
to make possible this careless reference to him.
&#8220;I guess Mr. Copeland is working harder than any
of us,&#8221; he added warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re all happier when we&#8217;re busy,&#8221; she
said lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not smoking, Jerry?&#8221; asked Eaton, proffering
cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve quit,&#8221; Jerry replied, remembering that he
had given up smoking in his general abandonment
of the joys of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland left him, making it necessary for
him to join Nan, who had moved a little away from
the circle they had formed before the fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you don&#8217;t tell your friends about
your troubles,&#8221; she remarked after a moment&#8217;s
silence. &#8220;So many things have happened that you
ought to be very cheerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been feeling very well,&#8221; he answered
doggedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;You do look utterly fagged out,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;But if I were you I wouldn&#8217;t cut all my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t cut anybody,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I guess
I know when to drop out. I want everybody to be
happy,&#8221; he said plaintively, feeling his martyr&#8217;s
crown pinching his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very sweet of you, Jerry. The policeman
at the market asked Saturday what had
become of you. Your absence seems to have
occasioned remark, though I hadn&#8217;t noticed it
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose you would,&#8221; he said, with an
effort at bitterness that was so tame that she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if you&#8217;ve lost interest, it&#8217;s all right.
I never meant to bore you. And I&#8217;m not complaining.
But you haven&#8217;t been kind to Mr. Eaton.
I suppose it never occurred to you that he&#8217;s taken
a good deal of pains to be nice to you. And just
now, just now,&#8221;&mdash;she added, lowering her voice,&mdash;&#8220;we
should all be as good to him as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned at this. If she and Eaton were in
love with each other, he saw no good reason why
he should be sorry for either of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a chance I could tell you some things,&#8221;
Nan continued, &#8220;but I suppose it&#8217;s just as well to
let you read about them in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>His spirits sank; he had been scanning the society
columns daily expecting to see the announcement
of her engagement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>&#8220;When I&#8217;m an old, old woman and living all
alone with my chickens somewhere, I suppose you
may come to see me again and tell me about your
troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied with a smile he meant to
be grim, &#8220;because I&#8217;ll be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>She regarded him with knit brows, puzzled,
slightly disdainful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when things were a little hard for me, and
I have been much troubled because one of the kindest
friends either of us ever had or could have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders impatiently, and
rebuke and indignation were mingled in the glance
she bent upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re not talking about the same
thing,&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;You know I mean to do
the square thing, Nan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so pathetic that she changed her tone,
sorry that she had been so hard on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you do&mdash;usually, Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be out to-morrow night if you&#8217;re
going to be at home,&#8221; he suggested timidly, her
reproach still upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re not too tired, or ill, or anything,
and can&#8217;t think of anything else to do, come along,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland called to Nan that it was time to
go. They had come in on the interurban, but Eaton
announced his intention of taking them home in
the Pembroke car.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use of my living in all this borrowed
splendor unless I use it. Jerry, please keep
the fire burning till I get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan&#8217;s smile as she gave him her hand conveyed
an apology for her harshness and sent his spirits
soaring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Torrington, as they
heard the car leave the door, &#8220;that you know how
fond my brother is of you. You&#8217;ve been a great
resource to him; he&#8217;s mentioned you often in his
letters. You know Cecil and I are very close,
unusually so; and it breaks my heart to see him&mdash;&#8221;
She waved her hand with a gesture that expressed
the futility of explanations.</p>

<p>She was taking him for granted as her brother&#8217;s
friend, not a mere beneficiary of his big-heartedness.
He was aware of something spacious in her nature;
she would brush little things away with a sweep of
her eloquent hands. A wonderful woman was John
Cecil&#8217;s sister. She was addressing him as though
he were a gentleman, a man of her own world,
instead of the miserable ingrate he knew himself
to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s lovely, quite adorable,&#8221; Mrs. Torrington
continued, as though speaking of matters they had
often discussed before. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say quite frankly
that I&#8217;d been afraid to meet her after what he had
written.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry sat silent, wondering. Nan had left him
mystified. He did not know what Eaton&#8217;s sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
was talking about unless it was his love for Nan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be leaving in a few days; my husband&#8217;s
business calls him to China. I want you to keep an
eye on Cecil; don&#8217;t let him be alone too much,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;A man with a sorrow like that in his
heart oughtn&#8217;t to be alone. I came here on purpose
to see just how the land lay; I suppose you
understand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He muttered incoherently, touched by her assumption
of his sympathy, her direct, intimate
appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt that I could speak to you quite frankly,&#8221;
Mrs. Torrington continued. &#8220;No one else seemed
quite so accessible, no one really quite so close to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, he has a lot of friends,&#8221; said Jerry
humbly, and anxious to respond to the demand this
fascinating woman was making upon his generosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going back to her husband; of course
you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a degree of indignation in her tone,
as though the person of whom she spoke was doing
an unpardonable thing.</p>

<p>Jerry felt himself shrinking; his hands clutched
the arms of his chair as it dawned upon him that
it was Mrs. Copeland&mdash;not Nan&mdash;of whom
Eaton&#8217;s sister was speaking. He was struck with
fear lest she should read his thoughts as he realized
how dull, how utterly selfish and contemptible, had
been his apprehensions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Mrs. Torrington, &#8220;that a man
as fine as Cecil is doomed to just this kind of
calamity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought maybe it would be Nan,&#8221; he faltered.
&#8220;I know he likes Nan, and he&#8217;s done a lot for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrington had been staring musingly into
the fire. She turned toward him absently, and
then, catching his meaning, her eyes widened with
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; she repeated slowly; and then, in her
usual brisk tone, &#8220;A man like Cecil can&#8217;t be passed
on from one affair to another so easily. And, besides,&#8221;&mdash;she
smiled her charming, irresistible
smile,&mdash;&#8220;that child is in love with you, you silly
boy! It&#8217;s in her eyes! That&#8217;s the one hopeful
thing about the situation&mdash;that together you two
will take good care of him!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>&#8220;JUST HELPING; JUST BEING KIND!&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan</span> crossed a pasture, whistling. The Holsteins,
nibbling the young grass, lifted their heads
and bent their slow, meditative gaze upon her.
She paused to pat one of them on the nose. Nan
was growing wise in dairy lore and knew at sight
the heaviest producers of the herd. She resumed
her whistling and went on toward the house, with
a pair of robins hopping before her. June had come
and summer sounds and scents filled the air.</p>

<p>As she neared the bungalow a motor swept
into the driveway and discharged Eaton and
Thurston.</p>

<p>&#8220;A child of the pastures! The daughter of Cincinnatus
tripping in from the fields!&#8221; observed
Eaton, as he shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just been tinkering an incubator, if you want the
facts&mdash;counting chickens before they&#8217;re hatched,&#8221;
laughed Nan, brushing a straw from her skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a small business matter to discuss
with you, Nan. We&#8217;ll fall upon it at once if you&#8217;re
agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business!&#8221; Nan mocked. &#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d
come to look at the dairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a very different Nan, Eaton reflected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
from the Nan of a year ago. Exposure to wind and
sun had already given her a becoming tan. Her old
listlessness, the defiant air she had sometimes worn,
had vanished; she had become alert, self-reliant,
resolute. Within the bounds of her self-respect she
meant that the world should like her. A democratic
young person&mdash;this new Nan, on good terms with
truck farmers, humble drivers of grocers&#8217; wagons,
motormen, and market-house policemen. In her
short skirt and plain blue blouse, she looked less
than her years to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can sit on the veranda if you gentlemen are
not afraid of the country air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare go in after that,&#8221; remarked
Thurston dryly; &#8220;Eaton already refers to me as
his learned senior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Eaton is the youngest and the oldest man
in the world!&#8221; Nan declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Farley,&#8221; Thurston began, as they
gathered about a wicker table and he drew a formidable
bundle of papers from a leathern pouch,
&#8220;as we telephoned you yesterday, the opposition
of Mr. Farley&#8217;s relatives has been disposed of and
your adoption was upheld by the court. To prevent
an appeal, and get rid of them for good, we&#8217;ve
agreed on your behalf to pay the two cousins ten
thousand dollars apiece. Mr. Eaton would have
preferred to fight it clear through, but I prevailed
on him not to make Brother Harlowe work too
hard. You may not know it, but Eaton is a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
belligerent person. There&#8217;s no compromise
in him. He&#8217;d fight to the last ditch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked from Eaton to Nan over his glasses
with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw a fellow I wanted to smash as
badly as I do Harlowe,&#8221; Eaton remarked. &#8220;He&#8217;s
the smoothest rascal I&#8217;ve ever known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that you&#8217;ve been very generous,&#8221;
said Nan. &#8220;How much will he get as a fee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About nine tenths of the twenty thousand,&#8221;
replied Thurston grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather less than that,&#8221; said Eaton, with one
of his elusive smiles. &#8220;I started the secretary of
the White River Trust Company down to see the
esteemed cousins before we signed the agreement;
told him to persuade them to confide their ill-gotten
gains to the company and advised them to
cut off Harlowe with a niggardly ten per cent for
his services. I was afraid to tell you that, Thurston.
I knew you would scold me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eaton, for combined ingenuity and malevolence,
you haven&#8217;t an equal!&#8221; declared Thurston,
chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; cried Nan, glad that the
interview was progressing so cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Farley,&#8221; Thurston resumed, &#8220;if
there&#8217;s anything a lawyer doesn&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s an
ungrateful client. Mr. Eaton and I have a sneaking
feeling that we&#8217;ve done pretty well with this
case. The credit is chiefly his&mdash;and I take off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
my hat to him. We&#8217;ve come here in the hope that
we shan&#8217;t have to argue with you, but just tell you.
Your scruples against accepting any share in Mr.
Farley&#8217;s estate, expressed after his death, did you
credit&mdash;in a way. But now it&#8217;s all yours; there&#8217;s
no escape. A considerable amount of income has
already accumulated, and we can arrange payments
necessary for your support to begin at once,
though the estate can&#8217;t be closed till the year of
administration is up. So far as your ability to
earn your own living is concerned, you have demonstrated
that. You have shown a plucky spirit, and
I admire it. I will go further, and say that the
community has supported you strongly, and that
your attitude has made many friends for you.
But now&mdash;now, we must have no more of this
nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand to indicate the fields, and
glanced meaningfully at Nan&#8217;s heavy walking-shoes,
which were disgracefully muddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that was settled&mdash;once and for all!&#8221; Nan
replied firmly. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think me ungrateful
for what you&#8217;ve done; but I thought that all out
before I came here, and I haven&#8217;t had a single
regret. If it isn&#8217;t impolite, I&#8217;ll say that all I want
is to be let alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thurston and I are not sentimentalists,&#8221; said
Eaton. &#8220;We&#8217;ve given you free rein to indulge
your whims; but now we&#8217;ve come to a point where
we&#8217;ve got to take a hand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t make me, if I won&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed
Nan. &#8220;Just think how humiliating it would be to
back down now after I said I wouldn&#8217;t! Worse
than that, think of the effect on these girls we have
at work here; they&#8217;d lose their respect for me if
they found I wasn&#8217;t really as poor as they are! And
there are other reasons, too,&#8221; she went on soberly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to go over this again, but I never
deserved anything of the Farleys. I&#8217;ve got my
conscience to live with, and I could never get on
with it if I allowed myself to take money which
papa knew it was best for me not to have. I&#8217;m
serious about this. He knew me better than I knew
myself. You understand what I mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it in the way you mean,
Nan,&#8221; Eaton answered; &#8220;but let&#8217;s not argue it.
Let&#8217;s be practical. Has it occurred to you that
something has to be done with this property? The
lawful heir can&#8217;t just walk off and leave an estate
like this. It will be confiscated by the State&mdash;thrown
into the treasury and spent by a lot of
politicians if you refuse it. Take the money and
buy a lot of farms with it or spend it on working
girls as much as you like&mdash;but please don&#8217;t talk
any more about refusing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton had spoken lightly, but she saw that he
was very much in earnest. The contingency he
suggested had not, in fact, occurred to her. She
had assumed from the beginning that the adoption
would be nullified and that Farley&#8217;s money would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
be divided among the obscure and shadowy cousins;
and this abrupt termination of the case brought
her face to face with an unforeseen situation.
Thurston was quick to take advantage of her
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to consider, Miss Farley, what your
foster-father&#8217;s feelings would be. He was a just man,
and all the wills he considered from time to time
prove that he never had the slightest intention of
disinheriting you. Even in the last will creating the
trusteeship, he made you his sole heir; it was really
the most generous of all! Oh, yes,&#8221; he exclaimed
hastily, as Nan colored deeply, &#8220;there was, I suppose,
a certain bitterness behind that. I want to say
to you again that I did my best to dissuade him
from that step. I was confident he would change
his mind about it, as he had about so many other
things in his varying moods and tempers; and that
he would realize its unkindness. We have no right
to assume that when he hid that will behind his
wife&#8217;s picture, he had any intention of executing
it. It&#8217;s an open question and it&#8217;s only fair to give
him the benefit of the doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; Nan assented; &#8220;but
when I read that will and found how bitter he had
been, I knew I had done the right thing in refusing
to take anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&#8221; Thurston continued
patiently. &#8220;You must be just; you must remember
that that was the act of a man near his death&mdash;nearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
than any of us imagined. He didn&#8217;t have
a chance to change his mind again. It&#8217;s unjust to
his memory to leave him in the wrong utterly, as
you will if you persist. There has already been a
great deal of talk about this attack on the adoption&mdash;people
have been blaming him for not guarding
against the possibility of any such thing. You see
public sentiment is behind you! And in spite of
anything you may say, your act would have the
appearance of pique; it would be like slapping a
dead man in the face!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thurston is right, Nan,&#8221; said Eaton.
&#8220;There is not only Mr. Farley&#8217;s memory as a kind
and just man to protect, but you must guard
yourself against even the appearance of resentment.
The only thing you have to consider is Mr. Farley&#8217;s
conscientious desire to provide for you, which was
manifest at all times. As Mr. Thurston says, that
last will gave you absolutely everything, cutting
out all the bequests he had made at other times
to benevolence and charity. My dear Nan, your
scruples are absurd! You haven&#8217;t any case at all!
The idea of letting the property Timothy Farley
spent a laborious lifetime accumulating go to the
State is horrible. I can readily imagine what his
feelings would be! Why, my dear Nan, rather than
let that happen, Thurston and I will steal the whole
thing ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>She received this with a grudging smile. What
they said about the injustice to Farley of a refusal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
impressed her, but her resolution was still unshaken.
And there was a stubborn strain in her of which
she had only lately been aware.</p>

<p>She reached for a pencil, and Eaton pushed a
pad of paper toward her. She began jotting down
Farley&#8217;s various bequests to charity, as provided in
the series of wills, pausing now and then to refer
to Thurston for items she only imperfectly remembered.</p>

<p>The total was three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. She tapped the paper reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; remarked Thurston anxiously, as
he saw what was in her mind, &#8220;you are not bound
by any of the legacies in those unsigned wills.
Not one of the wills contained all those bequests,
so your total doesn&#8217;t represent what he meant to
dispose of in that way. And his last will is evidence
that he had wholly changed his mind about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are bound to accept that last will as convincing
proof of his very great confidence in Miss
Farley,&#8221; said Eaton quickly, &#8220;rather than as an
expression of distrust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all know perfectly well what he meant by
that,&#8221; Nan replied. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to
think I have any feeling about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They nodded gravely as she glanced at them
appealingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; she went on hurriedly, &#8220;that my
refusal to accept anything at all might look like
resentment; that it would be in a way unjust to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
him.&#8221; She turned for a glance over the fields, as
though seeking their counsel. &#8220;Papa really wanted
to help people who hadn&#8217;t a chance; he was only
hard on the idle and shiftless. If he hadn&#8217;t been
big-hearted and generous, he never would have
taken me up as he did. And mamma was like him.
I feel strongly that even if he did change his mind
sometimes, his wish to help these things&mdash;the
Boys&#8217; Club, the Home for Aged Women, and all
the rest&mdash;should be respected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be done unless you take the whole,&#8221;
said Eaton quickly. &#8220;But you needn&#8217;t decide
about it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you should wait a few years at least!&#8221;
added Thurston, crossing his legs nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And since I&#8217;ve been out here and have learned
about the girls Mrs. Copeland is training to take
care of themselves, I&#8217;ve thought of some other
things that might be done,&#8221; said Nan, ignoring
their manifest unwillingness to acquiesce in the
recognition of Farley&#8217;s vacillating benefactions.
&#8220;There ought to be, in a town like this, a home
and training school for girls who start the wrong
way, or make mistakes. We haven&#8217;t anything
that quite fills that need, and there are a good
many such girls. A hundred thousand dollars
would provide such a place, and it ought to have
another hundred thousand for endowment. Mrs.
Copeland and I have talked of the need for such
a school. It would be fine to start something like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
that! And you know,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I might have
been just such a girl myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thurston turned to Eaton helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as plain as daylight,&#8221; Eaton remarked,
amused by the despair in his associate&#8217;s face, &#8220;that
you will soon pauperize yourself at this rate. It&#8217;s
only fair to tell you that the estate shrank on a
rigid appraisement of Mr. Farley&#8217;s property. The
million the newspapers mentioned has dwindled to
about eight hundred thousand. If you give away
all that&#8217;s mentioned in those wills and start this
girls&#8217; home, you won&#8217;t be able to keep more than
three automobiles for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the proof of the pudding is in the eating&mdash;and
I know it&#8217;s good!&#8221; Nan laughed. &#8220;I stuffed
myself so long without thinking about my hungry
neighbors that it won&#8217;t hurt me to pass the plate
down the table!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the main thing,&#8221; said Thurston, &#8220;is to
get your assurance that you&#8217;ll accept the estate
under your rights as Mr. Farley&#8217;s adopted daughter.
I suppose we can&#8217;t prevent your giving it away
without having you declared insane!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare you to try it!&#8221; Then, more serious than
at any time during the interview, she said: &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to let me reason it out my own way. It was
only a piece of luck that I wasn&#8217;t thrown into an
orphan asylum or left to die on the river bank
when the Farleys gave me a home. I shall never
forget that&mdash;never <i>again</i>,&#8221; she added with deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
feeling. &#8220;The least I can do is to pass my good luck
on. I&#8217;ve thought all that out, so please don&#8217;t make
me talk of it any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as the men rose to leave, Fanny appeared,
and urged them to remain to dinner. Thurston
pleaded an engagement in town; Eaton said he
would stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve broken that man&#8217;s heart, Nan,&#8221; Eaton
remarked, as Thurston rolled away in his machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do to him, Nancy?&#8221; asked
Fanny.</p>

<p>&#8220;She scared him to death! He&#8217;s convinced that
she&#8217;s headed for an insane asylum&mdash;that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
chuckled Eaton. &#8220;Mere altruism doesn&#8217;t interest
Thurston; he thinks it just a sign of weak character&mdash;worse
than a weak chin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always thought,&#8221; said Fanny, as her arm
stole around Nan, &#8220;that Nancy has a very nice
chin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might go further,&#8221; Eaton remarked daringly,
&#8220;and say that the face in its entirety is pleasant
and inspiring to look at!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop teasing me!&#8221; cried Nan, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll run out
to the barn and cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were still talking in this strain when Copeland&#8217;s
machine appeared in the driveway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you that we&#8217;re having a party
to-night,&#8221; said Fanny. &#8220;Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, Mr.
Amidon is driving that machine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>She walked to the veranda rail and looked expectantly
toward the approaching car. Though
Billy had lately paid a visit to the farm, Nan had
not met him. Fanny, with her usual frankness,
had warned Nan of the expected visit, and Nan
had carefully kept out of the way. She had not
seen Billy since the night he proposed the destruction
of Farley&#8217;s will.</p>

<p>Copeland jumped from the machine and ran up
the steps, while Jerry disposed of the car. He
shook hands with Fanny, and then turned toward
Nan inquiringly.</p>

<p>She was already walking toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Nan,&#8221; he said, and added
in a slightly lower tone, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you <i>here</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to see you&mdash;here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both knew what was in the other&#8217;s thoughts.
Copeland bowed slightly, and crossed to Eaton,
who was gazing fixedly at the gathering glories of
the sunset.</p>

<p>Jerry, in a gray suit, and the very tallest collar
he could buy, now added himself to the group.
He bent over Mrs. Copeland&#8217;s hand with his best
imitation of Eaton&#8217;s manner, and then, as he raised
his head, looked around furtively to see whether
his mentor was watching him.</p>

<p>The laughter that greeted this had the effect of
putting them all at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew Jerry could do it,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
didn&#8217;t suppose he would dare try it in his Cecil&#8217;s
presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; remarked
Eaton, feigning indignation at their treatment
of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not satisfied with
Jeremiah&#8217;s manners, we&#8217;ll both go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan ran away to change her clothes and reappeared
just as dinner was announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please sit wherever you happen to be,&#8221; said
Fanny, as they reached the dining-room; and then,
as they sat down, she bit her lip and colored, finding
that it fell to Copeland&#8217;s lot to sit opposite her.
Eaton, noticing her embarrassment, immediately
charged Copeland Farms with responsibility for the
high cost of living.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must watch Nan carefully, Mrs. Copeland.
She&#8217;s grinding the face of the poor. I heard Mrs.
Harrington complaining bitterly last night about
the price she has to pay for such trifling necessities
as eggs and butter. You&#8217;re going to bring a French
Revolution on this country if you&#8217;re not careful.
And there will be eggs thrown that don&#8217;t bear the
Copeland Farm&#8217;s stamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to have this suit spoiled with any other
kind,&#8221; Jerry protested. &#8220;Speaking of eggs&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; Nan interrupted. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
tell any of your country-hotel egg stories here. I
refuse to hear them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then; we&#8217;ll drop the eggs. I was shaking
hands with old friends on the lower Wabash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
last week and struck three slabs of cocoanut pie in
three days. I&#8217;m going to make a map of the pie
habits of the Hoosiers and send it out as a Copeland-Farley
advertisement. I&#8217;ve been all over the
State lately, and I&#8217;ve never found cocoanut pie
north of Logansport, and you never find it east of
Seymour going south. Down along the Ohio you
can stand on hotel porches in the peach season
and see thousands of acres of peaches spoiling on
the trees, and you go inside and find dried-peach
pie on the programme. And you have to eat it
or take sliced bananas or hard chunks of canned
pineapple. No wonder traveling men go wrong! I
wonder at times at my own pure life!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that they liked Jerry. They encouraged
him to talk, and he passed lightly from
Praxiteles, whom he had just discovered in a magazine
article, to the sinfulness of the cut-price drug
store, which he pronounced the greatest of commercial
iniquities.</p>

<p>After coffee on the veranda, Eaton quietly disappeared.
Then Jerry and Nan went off for a
stroll, leaving Copeland and Fanny together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s coming out all right,&#8221; remarked
Jerry, indicating the veranda with a wave of his
straw hat. &#8220;But it&#8217;s tough on Cecil. I&#8217;ve been
wondering whether <i>she</i> knows how it&#8217;s going to
hit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not! But that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll
never know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>&#8220;Of course, Cecil needn&#8217;t have done all the
things he did to bring them together again. He
might have let the boss go by the board. It wasn&#8217;t
just money that saved the boss! it was John Cecil&#8217;s
strong right arm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yours, too, Jerry! Oh, yes; I know more
about it than you think I do. You helped&mdash;you
did a lot to save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I did,&#8221; he admitted grudgingly, &#8220;that
was Cecil, too. I&#8217;d been busy rustling for myself&mdash;never
caring a hang for the other fellow&mdash;till
Cecil got hold of me. I&#8217;ve wondered a good deal
how he did it&mdash;a scrub like me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, Jerry; it had to be in you
first. But he does make people want to be different.
He&#8217;s certainly affected me that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; he exclaimed disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you ever think I&#8217;m proud of myself,
Jeremiah Amidon!&#8221; She paused abruptly at
the edge of a brook that tinkled musically on its
way to the river. &#8220;I&#8217;m only just beginning to try
to be self-respecting and decent and useful; I
think it&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun if I ever get
started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope to see you on the cars sometimes.
I&#8217;ve got the same ticket, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s
good on the limited. I&#8217;m likely to be chucked at
the first tank.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jumped the brook and followed a cow
path across a broad pasture, talking of old times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
on the Ohio, and of Farley, of whom Jerry always
spoke in highest reverence, and then of his own
prospects.</p>

<p>Both were subdued by the influences of the night.
The stars hung near; it seemed to Jerry that they
had stolen closer to earth to enfold Nan in their
soft radiance. A new idea had possessed him of
late. His heart throbbed with it to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a place like this,&#8221; he began slowly, &#8220;you
think a lot of things that wouldn&#8217;t strike you anywhere
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the dear country lonesomeness. I come
out here often in the evenings; used to in the winter,
when the snow was deepest. I love all this&mdash;&#8221;
She stretched out her arms with a quick gesture
comprehensive of the star-hung fields.</p>

<p>Jerry&#8217;s dejection increased. The more he saw of
Nan the less he seemed to count in her affairs.
A Nan who tramped snowy fields and took counsel
of the heavens was beyond his reach&mdash;immeasurably
beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take hold of things the way you do,
Nan. Being out here just makes me lonesome, that&#8217;s
all. I&#8217;ve got to be where I can see electric signs
spelling words on tall buildings. Just hearing that
trolley tooting away over there helps some; must
be because it&#8217;s going toward the lights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you feel so terribly, maybe we&#8217;d better go
back!&#8221; she said tauntingly and took a step downward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that again! If you leave me here in
the dark I&#8217;ll be scared to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>would</i> be a blow to the human race,&#8221; she
mocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had blows enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hide the scars well&mdash;I can say that!&#8221;
she flung back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Nan&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought John Cecil had broken you of the
&#8216;listen&#8217; habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it! You know perfectly well what I
want to tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, why do we linger? We really must go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My business is selling goods and it&#8217;s a rule of
the game never to let a customer turn his back on
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; you go first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan&#8221;&mdash;he drew nearer and planted himself
in her path&mdash;&#8220;you can&#8217;t go&mdash;not till I&#8217;ve promised
to marry you!&#8221;</p>

<p>This reversal of the established formula evoked
a gay laugh; but she did not attempt to pass him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never meant to ask you; I was afraid you&#8217;d
marry me for my money and I want to be loved
for myself alone! And don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be mentioning
it now if I wasn&#8217;t so lonesome I could cry!
If you&#8217;re going to take that money, it&#8217;s all off,
anyhow. I can&#8217;t afford to have anybody questioning
my motives. As far as loving you&#8217;s concerned,
I started full time that first day we met on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
river bank, when you pulled my fly out of the tree.
I might just as well have told you then&mdash;and I
wish I had!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t scold me about it now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not scolding. I&#8217;m just telling you what
you missed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you give me another chance? I
know I&#8217;m only a poor working girl&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan, I wish you were that!&#8221; he cried earnestly.
&#8220;But all that money&#8217;s coming to you now. I
wouldn&#8217;t have the nerve&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be the first time your nerve ever
failed!&#8221; Then, fearing she had wounded him, she
added quickly, &#8220;Of course, I didn&#8217;t mean that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t cry, little boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Nan!&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I wish you
cared even a little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal more than that, Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hands and kissed them. There was
a great awe in his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nan, this doesn&#8217;t seem right, you being you;
and you know what I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what you are, Jerry,&mdash;you&#8217;re
fine and loyal and good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try to be,&#8221; he said humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve helped me more than I could make
you understand, from that very first day we met,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
when I hated myself so! You brought back the
old days; everything that has happened since has
made me think of you. You were the only person
around here who really knew all about me&mdash;just
what I came from, and all that. And it helped
me to see how bravely you were fighting your own
way up. I had the chance forced on me that you
made for yourself. And I made a mess of everything!
Oh, Jerry!&#8221;</p>

<p>She clung to him, crying. As he kissed away her
tears, the touch of her wet cheek thrilled him....</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t be so happy we can&#8217;t remember
other people,&#8221; she said as they loitered hand in
hand toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the only way, Nan. That&#8217;s what
Cecil&#8217;s always saying. And I guess he&#8217;s about
right about everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton passed them, unconscious of their nearness.
He walked with head erect, as one who has fought
and won a good fight. A sense of all his victory
had cost him was in both their hearts. There was
an infinite pathos in his figure as he strode through
the dusk, returning to the woman he loved and to
the man he had saved and given back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough on Cecil,&#8221; said Jerry chokingly.
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem quite square, some way&mdash;I
mean the Copelands hitting it off again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we may be sure he doesn&#8217;t feel that way,&#8221;
Nan answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s all come out the way he
wanted it to. He brought them together.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_372.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE TOUCH OF HER WET CHEEK THRILLED HIM</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny, Nan; but I&#8217;m never dead sure I
catch Cecil&#8217;s drift&mdash;the scheme or whatever it is
he works by. I can&#8217;t find it in the books he gives
me to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t in books, Jerry; it&#8217;s in his heart&mdash;just
helping; just being kind!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
